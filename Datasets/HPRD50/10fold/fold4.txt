HPRD50.d13.s0	Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between CLIP-170 and LIS1
HPRD50.d13.s1	Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs
HPRD50.d13.s2	This work suggests that LIS1 is a regulated adapter between CLIP-170 and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-MT loading, and/or in the control of MT dynamics
HPRD50.d32.s0	Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans (perlecan, biglycan, decorin, and versican) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease
HPRD50.d32.s1	Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain
HPRD50.d32.s2	Overall, the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived PGs differentially interact with A beta, and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of perlecan
HPRD50.d32.s3	In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan
HPRD50.d32.s4	Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin ABC lyase
HPRD50.d32.s5	[35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin
HPRD50.d32.s6	Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
HPRD50.d17.s0	DGKdelta (type II isozyme) contains a pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus and a sterile alpha motif domain at the C terminus
HPRD50.d42.s0	Herein, we show that a distinct IkappaB protein Bcl3 also interacts with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays
HPRD50.d42.s1	In contrast to IkappaBbeta, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR
HPRD50.d42.s2	Bcl3 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA but not with TFIIEalpha in the GST pull-down assays
HPRD50.d42.s3	TBP and TFIIA, however, were not able to interact with IkappaBbeta
HPRD50.d42.s4	Accordingly, Bcl3 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of IkappaBbeta
HPRD50.d42.s5	In addition, coexpression of SRC-1 but not p300 further stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR
