HPRD50.d0.s0	Cloning and characterization of two evolutionarily conserved subunits (TFIIIC102 and TFIIIC63) of human TFIIIC and their involvement in functional interactions with TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III
HPRD50.d16.s0	GADD45b and GADD45g are cdc2/cyclinB1 kinase inhibitors with a role in S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints induced by genotoxic stress
HPRD50.d16.s1	Gadd45a (Gadd45), Gadd45b (MyD118), and Gadd45g (CR6) constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small, acidic, nuclear proteins, which have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis
HPRD50.d16.s2	Recent evidence has implicated Gadd45a in inhibition of cdc2/cyclinB1 kinase and in G2/M cell cycle arrest
HPRD50.d16.s3	Yet, whether Gadd45b and/or Gadd45g function as inhibitors of cdc2/cyclinB1 kinase and/or play a role in G2/M cell cycle arrest has not been fully established
HPRD50.d16.s4	In this work, we show that Gadd45b and Gadd45g specifically interact with the Cdk1/CyclinB1 complex, but not with other Cdk/Cyclin complexes, in vitro and in vivo
HPRD50.d16.s5	Data also has been obtained that Gadd45b and Gadd45g, as well as GADD45a, interact with both Cdk1 and cyclinB1, resulting in inhibition of the kinase activity of the Cdk1/cyclinB1 complex
HPRD50.d16.s6	Inhibition of Cdk1/cyclinB1 kinase activity by Gadd45b and Gadd45a was found to involve disruption of the complex, whereas Gadd45g did not disrupt the complex
HPRD50.d30.s0	The tyrosine kinase Tyk-2 is physically associated with the Type I interferon (IFN) receptor complex and is rapidly activated during IFN alpha stimulation
HPRD50.d31.s0	Raf1 interaction with Cdc25 phosphatase ties mitogenic signal transduction to cell cycle activation
HPRD50.d31.s1	We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes
