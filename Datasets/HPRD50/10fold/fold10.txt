HPRD50.d23.s0	A role for Plk1 phosphorylation of NudC in cytokinesis
HPRD50.d23.s1	Here, we characterize the interaction between Plk1 and NudC, show that Plk1 phosphorylates NudC at conserved S274 and S326 residues in vitro, and present evidence that NudC is also a substrate for Plk1 in vivo
HPRD50.d23.s2	Downregulation of NudC by RNA interference results in multiple mitotic defects, including multinucleation and cells arrested at the midbody stage, which are rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type NudC, but not by NudC with mutations in the Plk1 phosphorylation sites
HPRD50.d23.s3	These results suggest that Plk1 phosphorylation of NudC may influence cytokinesis
HPRD50.d39.s0	A prominent isolate, designated SRcyp/CASP10, specifically interacts with the CTD not only in vivo but also in vitro
HPRD50.d39.s1	SRcyp is a nuclear protein with a characteristic distribution in large irregularly shaped nuclear speckles and co-localizes perfectly with the SR domain-containing splicing factor SC35
HPRD50.d6.s0	Regulation of neutrophil adhesion by pituitary growth hormone accompanies tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin
HPRD50.d6.s1	These results suggest that pituitary GH modulates neutrophil adhesion through tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin and actin polymerization
HPRD50.d6.s2	Pituitary GH triggered the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and STAT3 in neutrophils
HPRD50.d6.s3	Preincubation with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the GH-stimulated adhesion and Jak2, STAT3, p125FAK, and paxillin phosphorylation
HPRD50.d6.s4	Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical association of Jak2 with p125FAK via STAT3 in vivo
HPRD50.d10.s0	Cutting edge: CD43 functions as a T cell counterreceptor for the macrophage adhesion receptor sialoadhesin (Siglec-1)
HPRD50.d10.s1	The 130- and 240-kDa sialoadhesin-binding glycoproteins were identified as the sialomucins CD43 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (CD162), respectively
HPRD50.d10.s2	CD43 expressed in COS cells supported increased binding to immobilized sialoadhesin
HPRD50.d10.s3	Finally, sialoadhesin bound different glycoforms of CD43 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, including unbranched (core 1) and branched (core 2) O:-linked glycans, that are normally found on CD43 in resting and activated T cells, respectively
HPRD50.d10.s4	These results identify CD43 as a T cell counterreceptor for sialoadhesin and suggest that in addition to its anti-adhesive role CD43 may promote cell-cell interactions
