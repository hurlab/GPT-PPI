HPRD50.d4.s0	In solution, FGFR4ed formed complexes with acidic FGF (FGF-1) and basic FGF (FGF-2), both in the presence and absence of heparin
HPRD50.d4.s1	Immobilized FGFR4 also bound FGF-8 besides FGF-1 and FGF-2
HPRD50.d25.s0	TR2 orphan receptor functions as negative modulator for androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells PC-3
HPRD50.d25.s1	BACKGROUND: Both androgen receptor (AR) and orphan receptor TR2 (TR2) belong to the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily and are expressed in prostate cancer tissue and cell lines
HPRD50.d25.s2	The interaction between AR and TR2 was assessed by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and mammalian two-hybrid system assay
HPRD50.d15.s0	Physical association of beta 2 integrin with GPI-80, a novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein with potential for regulating adhesion and migration
HPRD50.d15.s1	To clarify the mechanisms by which GPI-80 functions on leukocytes, we explored the possibility of its physical association with beta 2 integrin which is important for leukocyte adherence, locomotion, and extravasation
HPRD50.d15.s2	beta 2 integrin, detected by anti-CD18 mAb, was coprecipitated with GPI-80 from human neutrophil lysates by a mAb to GPI-80
HPRD50.d15.s3	In addition, GPI-80 was immunoprecipitated from human neutrophil lysates by anti-human CD18 mAb
HPRD50.d15.s4	These results clearly show that GPI-80 is physically associated with beta 2 integrin in human neutrophils
HPRD50.d41.s0	We report here that PLZF, and a structurally similar transcriptional repressor, BCL-6, can interact with a variety of corepressor proteins in addition to SMRT, including the mSin3A protein and (for PLZF) histone deacetylase-1
