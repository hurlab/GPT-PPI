527	The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PROTEIN1 distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of PROTEIN2 secretion from mouse but not rat islets
528	The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated PROTEIN1 isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different PROTEIN2 secretory responses under these unique conditions

530	The data obtained suggest (i) that selective PROTEIN1 receptors are present on the membranes of guinea-pig antral smooth muscle cells, (ii) that the oxytocin-related relaxation may result from the activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ conductivity via activation of PROTEIN2 induced release of Ca2+ from the submembrane located cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and (iii) in turn, this evokes a non-inactivating component of IK, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane
