25	We have recently shown that PROTEIN1 causes a PROTEIN2 (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells
26	In these cells, PROTEIN also causes the translocation of PROTEIN1 from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to PROTEIN2 activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date
27	In these cells, PROTEIN1 also causes the translocation of PROTEIN from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to PROTEIN2 activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date

29	Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PROTEIN in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether PROTEIN1 might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PROTEIN2 translocation and the release of ACTH
30	Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PROTEIN1 in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether PROTEIN might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PROTEIN2 translocation and the release of ACTH
31	Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PROTEIN1 in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether PROTEIN2 might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PROTEIN translocation and the release of ACTH
32	We conclude that: (1) PROTEIN causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the PROTEIN1 induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PROTEIN trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PROTEIN2 activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.
