210	We examined plasma PROTEIN PROTEIN1 mRNA, and adipose and muscle PROTEIN2 subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system

215	Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and PROTEIN1 produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in PROTEIN2 expression
216	Possible central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms could mediate these responses in that leptin receptors are located on hypothalamic neurons that coexpress PROTEIN1 (NPY) or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and both peptides that have been implicated as mediators of the CNS action of PROTEIN2

222	C75 inhibited expression of the prophagic signal PROTEIN1 in the hypothalamus and acted in a PROTEIN2 independent manner that appears to be mediated by malonyl-coenzyme A
223	Interactions between PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue
224	The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 in lipid mobilization
225	The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats
226	At equimolar concentrations of PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed
227	Summing up, new evidence suggests that PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level
228	Similarly, central PROTEIN1 treatment also had a greater effect in suppressing hypothalamic PROTEIN2 mRNA expression in young (-23+/-4%) than in old (-8+/-4%) rats compared with their age-matched pair-fed treated rats
229	 PROTEIN1 stimulated PROTEIN2 turnover in endometrium of ewes is influenced by stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins
230	Three experiments (Exp) assessed the influence of stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins (oCSP) on turnover of PROTEIN1 (the putative second-messenger for PROTEIN2 stimulated secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha) in ovine endometrium during luteolysis and maternal recognition of pregnancy
231	For each Exp, 100 mg endometrium was incubated, in duplicate, for 2 h with 10 microCi [3H] inositol and treated with 0 or 100 nM PROTEIN1 (OT) for 20 min, then [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (IP1, IP2, and PROTEIN2 respectively) were quantified
232	The influence of myrigalone B, a PROTEIN1 from the fruit exudate of Myrica gale L. on Cu(2+)-induced oxidation of low density lipoprotein from PROTEIN2 fed rabbits was investigated
233	During luteinization of bovine granulosa cells in vitro in the presence of PROTEIN1 or PROTEIN2 plus forskolin, there is a massive upregulation not only of progesterone production, but also of the gene for the peptide hormone PROTEIN with secretion of the peptide into the medium
234	During luteinization of bovine granulosa cells in vitro in the presence of PROTEIN1 or PROTEIN plus forskolin, there is a massive upregulation not only of progesterone production, but also of the gene for the peptide hormone PROTEIN2 with secretion of the peptide into the medium
235	During luteinization of bovine granulosa cells in vitro in the presence of PROTEIN or PROTEIN1 plus forskolin, there is a massive upregulation not only of progesterone production, but also of the gene for the peptide hormone PROTEIN2 with secretion of the peptide into the medium
236	Signal transduction of PROTEIN1 induced arachidonic acid release in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts: role of Ca2+ and the PROTEIN2 dependent activation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase
237	The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 or ionomycin, mimicked the effect of PROTEIN1 whereas the PROTEIN2 (PKC) activator, TPA, only induced a slight increase in AA release
238	Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PROTEIN1 inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PROTEIN2 betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the PROTEIN induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms
239	Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PROTEIN inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PROTEIN1 betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the PROTEIN2 induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms
240	Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PROTEIN1 inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PROTEIN betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the PROTEIN2 induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms
241	 PROTEIN1 or TPA-induced activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK were completely blocked by down-regulation of PROTEIN2 betaI, epsilon, and delta, but still occurred, together with the cytosolic PLA2 mobility shift, in the absence of external Ca2+
242	These results show that PROTEIN1 induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of PROTEIN2 betaI, epsilon, and delta
243	By comparison with the promoters of PROTEIN1 genes, which are also induced by PROTEIN2 we suggest that GARE is coupled with the upstream element and the pyrimidine box to form a PROTEIN response complex
