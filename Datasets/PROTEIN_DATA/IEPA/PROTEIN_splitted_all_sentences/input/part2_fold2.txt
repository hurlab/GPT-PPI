135	Effect of residual endogenous PROTEIN1 secretion on the abnormal PROTEIN2 response to hypoglycaemia in PROTEIN dependent diabetics
136	Effect of residual endogenous PROTEIN secretion on the abnormal PROTEIN1 response to hypoglycaemia in PROTEIN2 dependent diabetics
137	Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous PROTEIN1 secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates PROTEIN2 secretion
138	DESIGN: Case-control study: the PROTEIN response to PROTEIN1 induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous PROTEIN2 secretion
139	DESIGN: Case-control study: the PROTEIN1 response to PROTEIN induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous PROTEIN2 secretion

141	Blood samples for PROTEIN1 assay were taken just before the rapid injection of PROTEIN2 (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min
142	CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous PROTEIN1 secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the PROTEIN2 secretory system in IDDM
143	These findings led us to conclude that inositol trisphosphate [corrected] causes Ca2+ mobilization by muscarinic activation of PROTEIN1 leading to intracellular translocation of PROTEIN2 granules to the ready-releasable pool in pancreatic beta-cells via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chains
144	DNase1 footprints suggest the involvement of at least three types of transcription factors in the regulation of PROTEIN1 by PROTEIN2 
145	The regulation of PROTEIN1 genes by PROTEIN2 therefore involves an interplay of at least three different types of transcription factor
146	Analyses of hormone regulation of expression of mRNA for the aleurone RNase revealed that, like the pattern for PROTEIN1 mRNA levels increased in the presence of PROTEIN2 and its antagonist abscisic acid prevented this effect
147	Quantitative studies at early times demonstrated that cycloheximide treatment of aleurone layers increased mRNA levels 4-fold, whereas a combination of PROTEIN1 plus cycloheximide treatment was required to increase PROTEIN2 mRNA levels to the same extent
148	 PROTEIN1 is a satiety factor which acts within the hypothalamus to decrease the levels of several neuropeptides stimulating food intake (among them, PROTEIN2 [NPY]), while increasing those that inhibit food intake
149	Although the above data are consistent with a direct ability of PROTEIN1 to promote TRH biosynthesis through actions on TRH neurons, addition of a-MSH produced a 3.5 fold increase in TRH biosynthesis and release, whereas PROTEIN2 treatment suppressed ~3 fold proTRH biosynthesis
150	 PROTEIN1 as a modulator of PROTEIN2 
151	On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant PROTEIN1 (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of PROTEIN2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2')
152	We also show that PROTEIN1 counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of PROTEIN2 
153	A truncated form of PROTEIN1 encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with PROTEIN2 but does not affect its catalytic activity
154	These results disclose the potential of the PROTEIN1 to modulate the activity of PROTEIN2 a pleiotropic PROTEIN that is particularly abundant in the brain
155	These results disclose the potential of the PROTEIN1 to modulate the activity of PROTEIN a pleiotropic PROTEIN2 that is particularly abundant in the brain
156	These results disclose the potential of the PROTEIN to modulate the activity of PROTEIN1 a pleiotropic PROTEIN2 that is particularly abundant in the brain
157	Similarly, carbachol, but not PROTEIN1 or DDAVP, induced a significant increase in membrane-associated PROTEIN2 (PKC) enzyme activity
158	In contrast, PROTEIN1 had no effect on the distribution of any PROTEIN2 isoform tested
159	In the present study we found that at increasing PROTEIN1 concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced PROTEIN2 secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the PROTEIN response
160	In the present study we found that at increasing PROTEIN concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced PROTEIN1 secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the PROTEIN2 response
161	In the present study we found that at increasing PROTEIN1 concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced PROTEIN secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the PROTEIN2 response
162	These findings are consistent with increased PROTEIN1 signaling to the PROTEIN and POMC neurons in the ARC by physiological levels of circulating PROTEIN2 during normal feeding
163	These findings are consistent with increased PROTEIN1 signaling to the PROTEIN2 and POMC neurons in the ARC by physiological levels of circulating PROTEIN during normal feeding
164	These findings are consistent with increased PROTEIN signaling to the PROTEIN1 and POMC neurons in the ARC by physiological levels of circulating PROTEIN2 during normal feeding
165	 PROTEIN1 Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic PROTEIN2 Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice
166	 PROTEIN1 may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as PROTEIN2 (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake
167	We measured concentrations of PROTEIN1 and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular PROTEIN2 administration
168	No rapid-onset effects of PROTEIN1 on hypothalamic PROTEIN2 or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice
169	The addition of PROTEIN1 to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter PROTEIN2 or CRH secretion
170	Within 20 min after exposure to PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51%
171	The current study demonstrates that PROTEIN rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic PROTEIN1 and CRH and that these actions of PROTEIN2 within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone
