182	The aim of the present study was to investigate how PROTEIN1 given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of PROTEIN2 glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms	True
183	Subcutaneous injections of PROTEIN1 increased PROTEIN2 glucagon and glucose levels significantly	True
184	Two nanograms PROTEIN1 given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in PROTEIN2 levels at this time point	True
185	The PROTEIN1 antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased PROTEIN2 levels itself and therefore the effect on PROTEIN induced PROTEIN secretion was difficult to evaluate	False

189	The PROTEIN antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased PROTEIN1 levels itself and therefore the effect on PROTEIN2 induced PROTEIN secretion was difficult to evaluate	False
190	The PROTEIN antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased PROTEIN levels itself and therefore the effect on PROTEIN1 induced PROTEIN2 secretion was difficult to evaluate	True
191	Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng PROTEIN1 caused a significant rise not only of PROTEIN2 but also of glucagon and glucose levels	True
192	In contrast, nanogram amounts of PROTEIN1 administered ICV cause a rise of PROTEIN2 levels	True
193	8-OH-DPAT also increased PROTEIN1 and decreased CCK and somatostatin levels, effects that were blocked by pretreatment with the PROTEIN2 antagonist	True
194	Taken together, these data suggest that the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on plasma levels of PROTEIN1 somatostatin and CCK may be mediated by PROTEIN2 	True
195	In previous experiments, we have shown that following i.c.v. application of PROTEIN1 plasma levels of PROTEIN2 are increased through a cholinergic mechanism	True
196	Immunohistochemical localization of PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 in white and brown adipose tissue	False
197	To establish the cell type expressing PROTEIN1 we also assessed the size and organization of lipid droplets, the ultrastructural features of mitochondria, and the presence or absence of PROTEIN2 a brown fat-specific marker	False
198	In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular PROTEIN1 (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were PROTEIN2 negative, both in fed and fasted conditions	False
