707	Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of PROTEIN with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum PROTEIN1 concentrations and hypothalamic PROTEIN2 gene expression	False

710	These results demonstrate that chronic central infusion to produce a persistent elevation of the cytokine at pathophysiological levels (a situation that may normally manifest during infection, injury and inflammation) produced severe anorexia and weight loss in conjunction with reduction in both serum PROTEIN1 concentrations and hypothalamic PROTEIN2 gene expression	False
711	The ARC PROTEIN1 neurones are stimulated by starvation, probably mediated by falls in circulating PROTEIN2 and insulin (which both inhibit these neurones), and contribute to the increased hunger in this and other conditions of energy deficit	False
712	ARC PROTEIN neurones also mediate hyperphagia and obesity in the ob/ob and db/db mice and fa/fa rat, in which PROTEIN1 inhibition is lost through mutations affecting PROTEIN2 or its receptor	False

716	When PROTEIN1 signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the PROTEIN2 system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished.	False
