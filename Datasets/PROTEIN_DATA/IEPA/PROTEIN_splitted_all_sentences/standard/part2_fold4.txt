340	Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PROTEIN1 delta1, -beta1, or -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in PROTEIN2 secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell extracts.	False
