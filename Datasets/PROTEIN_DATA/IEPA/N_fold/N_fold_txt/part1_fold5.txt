5	SP ewes also had greater incorporation of [3H]inositol into PROTEIN1 (IP3) (+3449%, p less than 0.01) and total PROTEIN (IP) (+760%, p less than 0.08), in response to PROTEIN than did oCSP ewes (+553 and +168% for PROTEIN and total PROTEIN2 respectively) in endometrium collected at ovariectomy/hysterectomy on Day 16
20	The effect of PROTEIN1 was also inhibited in the presence of the PROTEIN2 inhibitor calphostin C
35	We conclude that: (1) PROTEIN1 causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the PROTEIN2 induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PROTEIN trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PROTEIN activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.
50	Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PROTEIN1 and -delta, but not PROTEIN2 and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM PROTEIN 
65	These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, PROTEIN1 PROTEIN PROTEIN2 and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins
80	Biphasic PROTEIN1 secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PROTEIN2 distinct from that activated by glucose
95	Pretreatment of HEK-293 cells for 2 min with carbachol, a mAChR agonist, lysophosphatidic acid, or ATP, followed by agonist washout, strongly increased (by 2-3-fold) maximal PROTEIN1 stimulation (measured >/=40 min later) by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, but not PROTEIN2 and largely enhanced PROTEIN sensitivity to these RTK agonists
110	Stimulation of 5HT-1D receptors with sumatriptan was unable to change neither AVP nor PROTEIN1 response to PROTEIN2 induced hypoglycemia
125	While PROTEIN1 maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms ( PROTEIN2 PROTEIN and PROTEIN , the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats
140	DESIGN: Case-control study: the PROTEIN1 response to PROTEIN2 induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous PROTEIN secretion
155	These results disclose the potential of the PROTEIN1 to modulate the activity of PROTEIN a pleiotropic PROTEIN2 that is particularly abundant in the brain
170	Within 20 min after exposure to PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51%
185	The PROTEIN1 antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased PROTEIN2 levels itself and therefore the effect on PROTEIN induced PROTEIN secretion was difficult to evaluate
200	In obese (db/db) animals, brown fat was composed mainly of small unilocular, PROTEIN1 positive adipocytes (mean diameter: 40.08 microns), which were also PROTEIN2 positive
215	Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and PROTEIN1 produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in PROTEIN2 expression
230	Three experiments (Exp) assessed the influence of stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins (oCSP) on turnover of PROTEIN1 (the putative second-messenger for PROTEIN2 stimulated secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha) in ovine endometrium during luteolysis and maternal recognition of pregnancy
245	By comparison with the promoters of PROTEIN genes, which are also induced by PROTEIN1 we suggest that GARE is coupled with the upstream element and the pyrimidine box to form a PROTEIN2 response complex
260	Inhibition of 5-HT3 serotonergic receptors with ondansetron (4 or 8 mg) did not modify the basal secretion of AVP and PROTEIN1 and the PROTEIN2 response to PROTEIN induced hypoglycemia
275	The expression of uterine PROTEIN and PROTEIN were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT PROTEIN mRNA expression and exogenous administration of PROTEIN1 resulted in induction of the uterine PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 levels
290	These results indicate that PROTEIN gene expressions during pregnancy are regulated tissue-dependently, and up-regulation of uterine PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN mRNA may be due to increased PROTEIN2 levels
305	 PROTEIN infusion diminished hypothalamic PROTEIN1 levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic PROTEIN2 mRNA levels in senescent rats
320	These results suggest that central PROTEIN1 stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of PROTEIN on muscle PROTEIN2 expression
335	In summary, we demonstrate that PROTEIN1 treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PROTEIN2 are expressed at sufficient levels.
350	There was also a very significant increase of PROTEIN after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 when 1000 mU hCG plus PROTEIN were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively)
365	These data indicate a GABAergic mediation of the inhibitory modulation by NO of the AVP and PROTEIN1 responses to PROTEIN2 induced hypoglycemia
380	 PROTEIN1 by intravenous or intracerebroventricular infusion for 5 h was associated with a decrease in PROTEIN2 mRNA in WAT (47-52%) and PROTEIN mRNA in SM (33-37%)
395	A negative correlation between WAT O2 consumption and PROTEIN expression was found in control animals, but not in the cafeteria-fed groups, suggesting a differential response to the beta3-adrenergic compound in lean and obese animals, which is in agreement with the reported statistical interactions between obesity and Trecadrine administration found for WAT O2 consumption and muscle PROTEIN1 expression, as well as for plasma PROTEIN and WAT PROTEIN2 expression
