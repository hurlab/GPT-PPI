14	The SGR and RGR also had different endocrine profiles with, for example, twice as high PROTEIN1 (p < 0.01) and PROTEIN2 levels (p < 0.01) in RGR compared to the SGR
29	Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PROTEIN in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether PROTEIN1 might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PROTEIN2 translocation and the release of ACTH
44	We previously showed that PROTEIN1 (AVP) stimulates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) induction through PROTEIN2 activation in aortic smooth muscle A10 cells
59	Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, PROTEIN1 PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia
74	The total intake of PROTEIN1 was inversely correlated with the plasma total PROTEIN2 concentration (TC) (r = -0.236, P: < 0.05) and plasma LDL PROTEIN concentration (LDL-C) (r = -0.220, P: < 0.05), after the adjustment for age, body mass index and total energy intake
89	 PROTEIN beta protein stimulation of PROTEIN1 was absent from LA-N-2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or PROTEIN2 beta peptide
104	Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal PROTEIN1 isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular PROTEIN isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal PROTEIN2 isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a PROTEIN specific PROTEIN 
119	In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular PROTEIN1 administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high PROTEIN PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN expression in all these tissues
134	Effect of residual endogenous PROTEIN1 secretion on the abnormal PROTEIN response to hypoglycaemia in PROTEIN2 dependent diabetics
149	Although the above data are consistent with a direct ability of PROTEIN1 to promote TRH biosynthesis through actions on TRH neurons, addition of a-MSH produced a 3.5 fold increase in TRH biosynthesis and release, whereas PROTEIN2 treatment suppressed ~3 fold proTRH biosynthesis
164	These findings are consistent with increased PROTEIN signaling to the PROTEIN1 and POMC neurons in the ARC by physiological levels of circulating PROTEIN2 during normal feeding
179	Administration of PROTEIN1 (1 microM) for 15 sec increased PROTEIN2 (IP3) formation by 61%
194	Taken together, these data suggest that the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on plasma levels of PROTEIN1 somatostatin and CCK may be mediated by PROTEIN2 
209	We examined plasma PROTEIN1 PROTEIN mRNA, and adipose and muscle PROTEIN2 subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system
224	The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 in lipid mobilization
239	Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PROTEIN inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PROTEIN1 betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the PROTEIN2 induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms
254	Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of PROTEIN1 on PROTEIN2 formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition
269	CONCLUSION: PTH, PROTEIN1 PGE2, and adenosine stimulate Ca2+ reabsorption via a pathway that is independent of cAMP and that involves a phorbol ester-insensitive PROTEIN2 isotype
284	The expression of uterine PROTEIN and PROTEIN were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT PROTEIN1 mRNA expression and exogenous administration of PROTEIN resulted in induction of the uterine PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 levels
299	We previously reported that adiposity and serum PROTEIN levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum PROTEIN1 are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic PROTEIN2 (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats
314	A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking PROTEIN1 induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle PROTEIN (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of PROTEIN2 prevented such a decrease in PROTEIN 
329	These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the PROTEIN1 induced expression of PROTEIN2 by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.
