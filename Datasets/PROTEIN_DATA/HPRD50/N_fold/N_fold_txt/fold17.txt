59	 PROTEIN associates with the beta-domain of PROTEIN1 and complexes with PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 in vivo
80	Thus, the ability of PROTEIN to degrade PROTEIN depends in part on its interaction with PROTEIN1 and suggests a new mechanism for PROTEIN2 stabilization in some PROTEIN deficient tumors
101	Here we provide evidence of how PROTEIN1 an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for PROTEIN2 GTPases, regulates cell adhesion
122	Overexpression of PROTEIN1 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a PROTEIN isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs
143	In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell ( PROTEIN -derived PROTEIN to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular PROTEIN1 deposits may be due to its interactions with PROTEIN2 
164	Characterization of EC and PROTEIN PROTEIN bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by PROTEIN1 weak binding by PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by PROTEIN PROTEIN a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
185	Immobilized PROTEIN1 also bound PROTEIN2 besides PROTEIN and PROTEIN 
206	We report here that PLZF, and a structurally similar transcriptional repressor, PROTEIN1 can interact with a variety of corepressor proteins in addition to SMRT, including the mSin3A protein and (for PLZF) PROTEIN2 
227	 PROTEIN ( PROTEIN , PROTEIN ( PROTEIN1 , and PROTEIN2 ( PROTEIN constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small, acidic, nuclear proteins, which have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis
248	Inhibition of PROTEIN cyclinB1 kinase activity by PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 was found to involve disruption of the complex, whereas PROTEIN2 did not disrupt the complex
269	 PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 memA interacts with PROTEIN PROTEIN and SRrp130 in corneal epithelial cells
290	Specific glutamines or lysines of PROTEIN1 were used to cross-link the different proteins, such as glutamines 495 and 496 to PROTEIN2 glutamine 288 to keratins, and lysines 468, 485, and 508 and glutamines 465 and 489 for interchain PROTEIN cross-links
311	 PROTEIN PROTEIN1 (' PROTEIN2 )-binding protein (CBP) interacting with transcription factors is able to increase their activity on target gene promoters
