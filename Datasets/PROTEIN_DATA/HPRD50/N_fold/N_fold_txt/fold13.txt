13	Subcellular fractionation and antibody-uptake experiments indicate that PROTEIN1 is indeed a type-I membrane protein, but, unlike other PROTEIN2 isoforms, lacks an N-terminal extracellular domain
34	Functionally, sumoylation of PROTEIN1 disrupts its ability to interact with histone deacetylases ( PROTEIN 2), but not with another interaction partner, PROTEIN2 
55	 PROTEIN1 associates with the beta-domain of PROTEIN2 and complexes with PROTEIN and PROTEIN in vivo
76	Thus, the ability of PROTEIN1 to degrade PROTEIN2 depends in part on its interaction with PROTEIN and suggests a new mechanism for PROTEIN stabilization in some PROTEIN deficient tumors
97	 PROTEIN dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide ( PROTEIN1 subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PROTEIN2 the core subunit of PROTEIN 
118	In addition, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 are required for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint to suppress DNA synthesis in response to MNNG, and phosphorylation of PROTEIN2 is required for cellular survival
139	Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of PROTEIN a specific PROTEIN1 to the PROTEIN protein (A beta)-containing PROTEIN2 deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain
160	Characterization of EC and PROTEIN PROTEIN bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by PROTEIN weak binding by PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by PROTEIN PROTEIN2 a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
181	Accordingly, PROTEIN1 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of PROTEIN2 
202	 PROTEIN1 detected by anti-CD18 mAb, was coprecipitated with PROTEIN from human neutrophil lysates by a mAb to PROTEIN2 
223	 PROTEIN ( PROTEIN , PROTEIN1 ( PROTEIN2 , and PROTEIN ( PROTEIN constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small, acidic, nuclear proteins, which have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis
244	Data also has been obtained that PROTEIN and PROTEIN as well as PROTEIN1 interact with both PROTEIN and cyclinB1, resulting in inhibition of the kinase activity of the PROTEIN2 cyclinB1 complex
265	 PROTEIN1 promotes coprecipitation of p85 with PROTEIN the signal-transducing component of the PROTEIN2 
286	Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving PROTEIN cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 PROTEIN keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, PROTEIN and unknown proteins related to the PROTEIN family
307	 PROTEIN PROTEIN1 (' PROTEIN2 )-binding protein (CBP) modulates co-operation between myocyte enhancer factor 2A ( PROTEIN and thyroid hormone receptor-retinoid X receptor
328	Transient expression of the full-length PROTEIN1 without RSRS in U1240MG glioblastoma cells resulted in repression of PROTEIN2 promoter activity
349	 PROTEIN a Rho family PROTEIN1 that interacts with signaling adapters PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
370	The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned PROTEIN and displays activity toward RhoA, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 in vitro
391	Here, we characterize the interaction between PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN show that PROTEIN phosphorylates PROTEIN at conserved S274 and S326 residues in vitro, and present evidence that PROTEIN2 is also a substrate for PROTEIN in vivo
412	Regulation of neutrophil adhesion by pituitary growth hormone accompanies tyrosine phosphorylation of PROTEIN1 p125FAK, and PROTEIN2 
433	These results identify PROTEIN1 as a T cell counterreceptor for PROTEIN2 and suggest that in addition to its anti-adhesive role PROTEIN may promote cell-cell interactions
