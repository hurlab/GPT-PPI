121	Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 
142	In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell ( PROTEIN -derived PROTEIN1 to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular PROTEIN deposits may be due to its interactions with PROTEIN2 
163	Characterization of EC and PROTEIN1 PROTEIN bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by PROTEIN2 weak binding by PROTEIN and PROTEIN two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by PROTEIN PROTEIN a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
184	Immobilized PROTEIN also bound PROTEIN1 besides PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
205	These results clearly show that PROTEIN1 is physically associated with PROTEIN2 in human neutrophils
226	 PROTEIN ( PROTEIN1 , PROTEIN ( PROTEIN , and PROTEIN2 ( PROTEIN constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small, acidic, nuclear proteins, which have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis
247	Inhibition of PROTEIN1 cyclinB1 kinase activity by PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN was found to involve disruption of the complex, whereas PROTEIN did not disrupt the complex
