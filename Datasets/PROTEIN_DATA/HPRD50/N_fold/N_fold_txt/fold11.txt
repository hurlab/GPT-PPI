11	Here, we cloned and characterized a mouse orthologue of human PROTEIN protein as an atypical PROTEIN1 (named PROTEIN2 
32	Functionally, sumoylation of PROTEIN1 disrupts its ability to interact with histone deacetylases ( PROTEIN2 2), but not with another interaction partner, PROTEIN 
53	We establish that PROTEIN binds to PROTEIN1 ( PROTEIN2 , a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome
74	Thus, the ability of PROTEIN to degrade PROTEIN1 depends in part on its interaction with PROTEIN and suggests a new mechanism for PROTEIN2 stabilization in some PROTEIN deficient tumors
95	 PROTEIN1 dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide ( PROTEIN2 subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PROTEIN the core subunit of PROTEIN 
116	In contrast, phosphorylation of PROTEIN1 by ATR is independent of PROTEIN and replication protein A, suggesting that the signaling pathway leading to PROTEIN2 phosphorylation is distinct from that mediated by the checkpoint proteins
137	Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of PROTEIN1 a specific PROTEIN to the PROTEIN protein (A beta)-containing PROTEIN2 deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain
158	Characterization of EC and PROTEIN PROTEIN bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by PROTEIN weak binding by PROTEIN and PROTEIN two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
179	 PROTEIN specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN TBP, and PROTEIN1 but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN2 pull-down assays
200	To clarify the mechanisms by which PROTEIN1 functions on leukocytes, we explored the possibility of its physical association with PROTEIN2 which is important for leukocyte adherence, locomotion, and extravasation
221	 PROTEIN ( PROTEIN , PROTEIN ( PROTEIN , and PROTEIN1 ( PROTEIN2 constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small, acidic, nuclear proteins, which have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis
242	Data also has been obtained that PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 as well as PROTEIN2 interact with both PROTEIN and cyclinB1, resulting in inhibition of the kinase activity of the PROTEIN cyclinB1 complex
263	RESULTS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 is upregulated by PROTEIN1 in both LNCaP and PROTEIN2 
284	Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving PROTEIN cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including PROTEIN1 PROTEIN PROTEIN keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, PROTEIN and unknown proteins related to the PROTEIN2 family
305	 PROTEIN1 PROTEIN (' PROTEIN2 )-binding protein (CBP) modulates co-operation between myocyte enhancer factor 2A ( PROTEIN and thyroid hormone receptor-retinoid X receptor
326	The results of density gradient centrifugation experiments show that, in contrast to hU3-55K, the human PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN proteins predominantly interact with the U3 PROTEIN2 in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes
347	 PROTEIN a Rho family PROTEIN1 that interacts with signaling adapters PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 
368	This work led to identification of a novel PROTEIN1 ( PROTEIN2 for Rho family GTPases
389	Here, we characterize the interaction between PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 show that PROTEIN phosphorylates PROTEIN2 at conserved S274 and S326 residues in vitro, and present evidence that PROTEIN is also a substrate for PROTEIN in vivo
410	A prominent isolate, designated PROTEIN1 PROTEIN specifically interacts with the PROTEIN2 not only in vivo but also in vitro
431	These results identify PROTEIN as a T cell counterreceptor for PROTEIN1 and suggest that in addition to its anti-adhesive role PROTEIN2 may promote cell-cell interactions
