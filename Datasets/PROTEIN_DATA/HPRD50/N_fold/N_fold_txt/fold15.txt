141	Overall, the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived PROTEIN1 differentially interact with A beta, and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of PROTEIN2 
162	Characterization of EC and PROTEIN PROTEIN bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by PROTEIN1 weak binding by PROTEIN and PROTEIN two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by PROTEIN2 PROTEIN a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan

204	In addition, PROTEIN1 was immunoprecipitated from human neutrophil lysates by anti-human PROTEIN2 mAb
225	 PROTEIN ( PROTEIN1 , PROTEIN ( PROTEIN2 , and PROTEIN ( PROTEIN constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small, acidic, nuclear proteins, which have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis
