31	 PROTEIN is modified by PROTEIN1 in vivo and in vitro and the region of PROTEIN2 responsible for interaction maps to the N-terminal regulatory domain
52	We establish that PROTEIN1 binds to PROTEIN ( PROTEIN2 , a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome
73	A PROTEIN1 mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with PROTEIN2 but not PROTEIN and does not promote degradation of PROTEIN 
94	 PROTEIN1 dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide ( PROTEIN subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PROTEIN2 the core subunit of PROTEIN 
115	In contrast, phosphorylation of PROTEIN by ATR is independent of PROTEIN1 and replication protein A, suggesting that the signaling pathway leading to PROTEIN2 phosphorylation is distinct from that mediated by the checkpoint proteins
136	Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of PROTEIN1 a specific PROTEIN to the PROTEIN2 protein (A beta)-containing PROTEIN deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain
157	Characterization of EC and PROTEIN PROTEIN1 bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by PROTEIN weak binding by PROTEIN and PROTEIN two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by PROTEIN PROTEIN2 a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
178	 PROTEIN specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN1 TBP, and PROTEIN but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN2 pull-down assays
199	Physical association of PROTEIN1 with PROTEIN2 a novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein with potential for regulating adhesion and migration
220	 PROTEIN ( PROTEIN , PROTEIN ( PROTEIN1 , and PROTEIN ( PROTEIN2 constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small, acidic, nuclear proteins, which have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis
241	Data also has been obtained that PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN as well as PROTEIN interact with both PROTEIN and cyclinB1, resulting in inhibition of the kinase activity of the PROTEIN2 cyclinB1 complex
262	 PROTEIN1 activates PROTEIN2 which inhibits apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell lines
