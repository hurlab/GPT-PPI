171	 PROTEIN1 (type II isozyme) contains a PROTEIN2 homology domain at the N terminus and a sterile alpha motif domain at the C terminus
172	Herein, we show that a distinct IkappaB protein PROTEIN1 also interacts with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and PROTEIN2 pull-down assays
173	In contrast to PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR
174	 PROTEIN1 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN2 TBP, and PROTEIN but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN pull-down assays
175	 PROTEIN1 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN TBP, and PROTEIN2 but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN pull-down assays
176	 PROTEIN1 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN TBP, and PROTEIN but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN2 pull-down assays
177	 PROTEIN specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN1 TBP, and PROTEIN2 but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN pull-down assays
178	 PROTEIN specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN1 TBP, and PROTEIN but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN2 pull-down assays
179	 PROTEIN specifically interacted with the general transcription factors PROTEIN TBP, and PROTEIN1 but not with TFIIEalpha in the PROTEIN2 pull-down assays
180	TBP and PROTEIN1 however, were not able to interact with PROTEIN2 
181	Accordingly, PROTEIN1 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of PROTEIN2 
182	In addition, coexpression of PROTEIN1 but not PROTEIN2 further stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR
