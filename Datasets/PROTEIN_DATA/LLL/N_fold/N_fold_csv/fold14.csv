14,"We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 control region.",False,U_8
50,"In this mutant, expression of the PROTEIN gene, whose transcription depends on both PROTEIN1 and the phosphorylated PROTEIN2 protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.",False,U_23
86,"The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN1 the PROTEIN2 PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN ",False,U_27
122,"Previously, it was shown that the PROTEIN1 protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the PROTEIN2 gene encoding sigmaK.",True,U_33
158,"Therefore, PROTEIN is solely expressed during sporulation from a PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 controlled promoter that is located immediately upstream of ftsY inside the smc gene.",False,U_43
194,"The PROTEIN1 promoter, like the PROTEIN promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN may inhibit PROTEIN2 activity late in sporulation.",False,U_54
230,"A low concentration of PROTEIN activated PROTEIN transcription by final PROTEIN1 RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN2 or PROTEIN ",False,U_64
266,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN ",False,U_70
302,"However, the mutant was unable to stimulate transcription by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase from the PROTEIN1 dependent PROTEIN2 operon promoter.",True,U_71
