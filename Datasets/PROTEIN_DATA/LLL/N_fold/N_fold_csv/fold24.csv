96,"The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN ",False,U_27
132,"A low level of PROTEIN1 activated transcription of PROTEIN2 by PROTEIN RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of PROTEIN repressed PROTEIN transcription.",True,U_35
168,"Furthermore, PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 seemed to be induced after phosphate starvation in the wild type in a PROTEIN2 dependent manner and in the sigB mutant probably via PROTEIN ",True,U_47
204,From these results we conclude that PROTEIN negatively regulates PROTEIN1 expression by preventing PROTEIN2 driven transcription of PROTEIN possibly through interaction with the control region.,False,U_59
