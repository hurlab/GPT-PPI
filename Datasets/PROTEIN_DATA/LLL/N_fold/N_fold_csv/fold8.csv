8,"The PROTEIN1 gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by PROTEIN2 containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression PROTEIN a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS).",True,U_5
44,The results indicate that PROTEIN1 is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN2 promoter.,True,U_19
80,"The PROTEIN1 regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN2 and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.",True,U_25
116,The PROTEIN1 phosphatase indirectly activates PROTEIN by dephosphorylating a protein ( PROTEIN2 in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.,True,U_31
152,"This indicates that the PROTEIN gene product, being a member of both the PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the PROTEIN2 regulon.",False,U_41
188,"The PROTEIN1 promoter, like the PROTEIN promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN2 may inhibit PROTEIN activity late in sporulation.",False,U_54
224,"Transcription of the PROTEIN PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 genes by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called PROTEIN ",False,U_62
260,"PROTEIN1 is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN2 an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN back to the active form.",True,U_69
296,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN2 ",False,U_70
