15,"We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN PROTEIN control region.",False,U_8
51,"In this mutant, expression of the PROTEIN1 gene, whose transcription depends on both PROTEIN and the phosphorylated PROTEIN2 protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.",True,U_23
87,"The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN1 the PROTEIN PROTEIN2 operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN ",False,U_27
123,These results demonstrate that PROTEIN1 dependent transcription of PROTEIN initiates a negative feedback loop in which PROTEIN2 acts as a repressor to limit production of PROTEIN ,False,U_34
159,The expression of PROTEIN is under the control of both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 ,False,U_44
195,"The PROTEIN1 promoter, like the PROTEIN2 promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN may inhibit PROTEIN activity late in sporulation.",False,U_54
231,"A low concentration of PROTEIN1 activated PROTEIN transcription by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN2 or PROTEIN ",True,U_64
267,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN1 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN ",False,U_70
