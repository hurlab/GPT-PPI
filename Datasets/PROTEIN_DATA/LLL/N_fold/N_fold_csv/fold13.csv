13,"We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN PROTEIN2 control region.",True,U_8
49,"Finally, we show that proper localization of SpoIVA required the expression of one or more genes which, like PROTEIN1 are under the control of the mother cell transcription factor PROTEIN2 ",True,U_22
85,"The PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN2 the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN ",True,U_27
121,"Most PROTEIN1 genes, and the PROTEIN2 gene, are transcribed by PROTEIN RNA polymerase.",False,U_32
157,"Therefore, PROTEIN1 is solely expressed during sporulation from a PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN controlled promoter that is located immediately upstream of ftsY inside the smc gene.",True,U_43
193,"The PROTEIN promoter, like the PROTEIN1 promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN2 RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN may inhibit PROTEIN activity late in sporulation.",True,U_54
229,"A low concentration of PROTEIN activated PROTEIN transcription by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN1 or PROTEIN2 ",False,U_64
265,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN1 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN ",False,U_70
