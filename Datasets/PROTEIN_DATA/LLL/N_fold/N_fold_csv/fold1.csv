1,Our results indicate that the level of PROTEIN1 level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on PROTEIN2 because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores.,True,U_1
37,"Although PROTEIN1 is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the PROTEIN2 phosphorelay, there is considerable evidence implicating a mechanism of post-translational control that governs the activity and concentration of sigmaH.",True,U_15
73,"The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN1 , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN2 and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.",False,U_25
109,"The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of PROTEIN1 depends on the cell division protein PROTEIN2 and could correspond to the PROTEIN dependent assembly of PROTEIN into E-rings.",True,U_28
145,"The PROTEIN dependent promoter drives expression of PROTEIN1 under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a PROTEIN2 dependent promoter is responsible for PROTEIN transcription following amino acid limitation.",False,U_40
181,Three new PROTEIN dependent genes ( PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN encoding proteins with still unknown functions were also described.,False,U_52
217,"Transcription of the PROTEIN PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN genes by final PROTEIN2 RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called PROTEIN ",True,U_62
253,"Analysis of the expression of a translational ywhE-lacZ fusion showed that PROTEIN1 expression is sporulation-specific, and is controlled predominantly by the forespore-specific sigma factor PROTEIN2 and to a lesser extent by PROTEIN ",True,U_67
289,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN2 ",True,U_70
325,"Our data demonstrate that the PROTEIN1 protein acts as a global repressor of the PROTEIN operon, as well as other class III heat shock genes, by preventing unstressed transcription from either the PROTEIN2 or PROTEIN dependent promoter and might be inactivated or dissociate under inducing stress conditions.",False,U_77
