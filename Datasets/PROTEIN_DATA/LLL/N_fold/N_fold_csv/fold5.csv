5,"The -10 and -35 sequences of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN dependent promoters of PROTEIN2 overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide.",True,U_3
41,The results indicate that PROTEIN1 is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN promoter.,True,U_19
77,"The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN1 and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN2 and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.",False,U_25
113,Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that PROTEIN blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated PROTEIN1 to activate PROTEIN2 until formation of the polar septum is completed.,True,U_29
149,"This indicates that the PROTEIN gene product, being a member of both the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the PROTEIN regulon.",False,U_41
185,Production of PROTEIN about 1 h earlier than normal does affect PROTEIN1 which when phosphorylated is an activator of PROTEIN2 transcription.,True,U_53
221,"Transcription of the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called PROTEIN2 ",True,U_62
257,"PROTEIN1 is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN2 and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN back to the active form.",True,U_69
293,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN2 ",False,U_70
329,"Our data demonstrate that the PROTEIN protein acts as a global repressor of the PROTEIN1 operon, as well as other class III heat shock genes, by preventing unstressed transcription from either the PROTEIN2 or PROTEIN dependent promoter and might be inactivated or dissociate under inducing stress conditions.",True,U_77
