112,Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that PROTEIN1 blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated PROTEIN2 to activate PROTEIN until formation of the polar septum is completed.,True,U_29
148,"The PROTEIN dependent promoter drives expression of PROTEIN under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a PROTEIN1 dependent promoter is responsible for PROTEIN2 transcription following amino acid limitation.",True,U_40
184,Production of PROTEIN1 about 1 h earlier than normal does affect PROTEIN2 which when phosphorylated is an activator of PROTEIN transcription.,True,U_53
