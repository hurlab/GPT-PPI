7,"The PROTEIN gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by PROTEIN1 containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression PROTEIN2 a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS).",False,U_5
43,The results indicate that PROTEIN is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN promoter.,False,U_19
79,"The PROTEIN1 regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN2 , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.",True,U_25
115,Cell-specific activation of transcription factor PROTEIN1 during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires the formation of the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase ( PROTEIN2 located in the septum.,True,U_30
151,"This indicates that the PROTEIN1 gene product, being a member of both the PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the PROTEIN regulon.",True,U_41
187,"The PROTEIN promoter, like the PROTEIN promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN1 RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN2 may inhibit PROTEIN activity late in sporulation.",False,U_54
223,"Transcription of the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN genes by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called PROTEIN ",False,U_62
259,"PROTEIN is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN1 an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN2 back to the active form.",False,U_69
295,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN2 of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN ",False,U_70
