12,"We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN PROTEIN2 control region.",True,U_8
48,"PROTEIN1 binds to a site on one of these promoters, PROTEIN2 that overlaps its -35 region.",True,U_21
84,Primer extension experiments and Northern blot analysis show that an active PROTEIN1 dependent promoter precedes PROTEIN2 and transcription is terminated at the putative p-independent terminator downstream of kdgT.,True,U_26
120,"Most PROTEIN1 genes, and the PROTEIN gene, are transcribed by PROTEIN2 RNA polymerase.",True,U_32
156,"Therefore, PROTEIN1 is solely expressed during sporulation from a PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 controlled promoter that is located immediately upstream of ftsY inside the smc gene.",True,U_43
192,"The PROTEIN promoter, like the PROTEIN promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN1 RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN may inhibit PROTEIN2 activity late in sporulation.",False,U_54
228,"In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of PROTEIN1 gene expression results from the combined action of PROTEIN and another transcription factor, PROTEIN2 ",True,U_63
264,"PROTEIN1 is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN2 which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN back to the active form.",True,U_69
300,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN1 present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN2 ",False,U_70
