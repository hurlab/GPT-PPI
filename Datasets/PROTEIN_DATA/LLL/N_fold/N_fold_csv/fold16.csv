52,"In this mutant, expression of the PROTEIN1 gene, whose transcription depends on both PROTEIN2 and the phosphorylated PROTEIN protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.",True,U_23
88,"The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN1 the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN2 and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN ",False,U_27
124,These results demonstrate that PROTEIN1 dependent transcription of PROTEIN2 initiates a negative feedback loop in which PROTEIN acts as a repressor to limit production of PROTEIN ,True,U_34
160,The expression of PROTEIN1 is under the control of both PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 ,True,U_44
