10,"Unlike the case for other PROTEIN1 dependent genes, PROTEIN2 has no UAS; instead, its expression depends on a sequence located 1.5 kilobases downstream of the rocG promoter, beyond the end of the rocG coding region.",True,U_6
46,The results indicate that PROTEIN is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN2 promoter.,False,U_19
82,"The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN1 , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN2 and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.",False,U_25
118,The PROTEIN1 phosphatase indirectly activates PROTEIN2 by dephosphorylating a protein ( PROTEIN in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.,True,U_31
154,"This indicates that the PROTEIN1 gene product, being a member of both the PROTEIN and PROTEIN regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the PROTEIN2 regulon.",True,U_41
190,"The PROTEIN promoter, like the PROTEIN1 promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN2 may inhibit PROTEIN activity late in sporulation.",False,U_54
226,"In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of PROTEIN gene expression results from the combined action of PROTEIN1 and another transcription factor, PROTEIN2 ",False,U_63
262,"PROTEIN1 is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN2 back to the active form.",False,U_69
298,"The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN1 of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN2 ",False,U_70
