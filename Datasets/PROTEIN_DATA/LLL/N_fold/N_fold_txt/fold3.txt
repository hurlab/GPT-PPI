3	The -10 and -35 sequences of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 dependent promoters of PROTEIN overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide.
39	In contrast, PROTEIN1 is transcribed in the forespore compartment by RNA polymerase with the forespore-specific PROTEIN2 and appears to give a monocistronic transcript.
75	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN1 and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN2 , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
111	The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of PROTEIN1 depends on the cell division protein PROTEIN and could correspond to the PROTEIN2 dependent assembly of PROTEIN into E-rings.
147	The PROTEIN1 dependent promoter drives expression of PROTEIN under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a PROTEIN2 dependent promoter is responsible for PROTEIN transcription following amino acid limitation.
183	Three new PROTEIN dependent genes ( PROTEIN PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 encoding proteins with still unknown functions were also described.
219	Transcription of the PROTEIN PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 genes by final PROTEIN2 RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called PROTEIN 
255	PROTEIN is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN1 an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN2 and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN back to the active form.
291	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
327	Our data demonstrate that the PROTEIN1 protein acts as a global repressor of the PROTEIN2 operon, as well as other class III heat shock genes, by preventing unstressed transcription from either the PROTEIN or PROTEIN dependent promoter and might be inactivated or dissociate under inducing stress conditions.
