9	The PROTEIN1 gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by PROTEIN containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression PROTEIN2 a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS).
45	The results indicate that PROTEIN1 is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN promoter.
81	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN1 , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN2 , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
117	The PROTEIN phosphatase indirectly activates PROTEIN1 by dephosphorylating a protein ( PROTEIN2 in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.
153	This indicates that the PROTEIN1 gene product, being a member of both the PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the PROTEIN regulon.
189	The PROTEIN promoter, like the PROTEIN promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN1 may inhibit PROTEIN2 activity late in sporulation.
225	Transcription of the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 genes by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called PROTEIN 
261	PROTEIN is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN1 an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN2 which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN back to the active form.
297	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN1 present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN
