35	The expression of the PROTEIN1 operon was induced by the presence of isoleucine or valine in the growth medium and depended upon the presence of the sigma factor PROTEIN2 a member of the sigma 54 family.
71	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN1 , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN2 , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
107	The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of PROTEIN1 depends on the cell division protein PROTEIN and could correspond to the PROTEIN dependent assembly of PROTEIN2 into E-rings.
143	The PROTEIN1 dependent promoter drives expression of PROTEIN2 under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a PROTEIN dependent promoter is responsible for PROTEIN transcription following amino acid limitation.
179	Three new PROTEIN1 dependent genes ( PROTEIN PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN encoding proteins with still unknown functions were also described.
215	DNase I footprinting showed that PROTEIN1 binds strongly to two sites in the PROTEIN promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the PROTEIN promoter, and does not bind specifically to PROTEIN2 
251	Analysis of the expression of a translational ywhE-lacZ fusion showed that PROTEIN1 expression is sporulation-specific, and is controlled predominantly by the forespore-specific sigma factor PROTEIN and to a lesser extent by PROTEIN2 
287	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
323	The Bacillus subtilis PROTEIN1 operon is regulated by two stress induction pathways relying on either PROTEIN2 or a class III stress induction mechanism acting at a PROTEIN like promoter.
