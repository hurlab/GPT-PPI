14	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 control region.
50	In this mutant, expression of the PROTEIN gene, whose transcription depends on both PROTEIN1 and the phosphorylated PROTEIN2 protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.
86	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN1 the PROTEIN2 PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
122	Previously, it was shown that the PROTEIN1 protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the PROTEIN2 gene encoding sigmaK.
158	Therefore, PROTEIN is solely expressed during sporulation from a PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 controlled promoter that is located immediately upstream of ftsY inside the smc gene.
194	The PROTEIN1 promoter, like the PROTEIN promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN may inhibit PROTEIN2 activity late in sporulation.
230	A low concentration of PROTEIN activated PROTEIN transcription by final PROTEIN1 RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN2 or PROTEIN 
266	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
302	However, the mutant was unable to stimulate transcription by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase from the PROTEIN1 dependent PROTEIN2 operon promoter.
