17	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN2 PROTEIN control region.
53	In the shaA mutant, PROTEIN1 dependent expression of PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 at an early stage of sporulation was sensitive to external NaCl.
89	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN2 the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
125	These results demonstrate that PROTEIN1 dependent transcription of PROTEIN initiates a negative feedback loop in which PROTEIN acts as a repressor to limit production of PROTEIN2 
161	The expression of PROTEIN1 is under the control of both PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
197	In the mother cell compartment of sporulating cells, expression of the PROTEIN1 gene, encoding the earlier-acting sigma factor, sigmaE, is negatively regulated by the later-acting sigma factor, PROTEIN2 
233	A low concentration of PROTEIN activated PROTEIN transcription by final PROTEIN1 RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN or PROTEIN2 
269	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN1 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
305	Localization of PROTEIN1 was shown to be dependent on the essential cell division protein PROTEIN2
