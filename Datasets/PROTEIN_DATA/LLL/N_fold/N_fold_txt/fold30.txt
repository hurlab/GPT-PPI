30	These results suggest that PROTEIN1 may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN2 PROTEIN PROTEIN and PROTEIN 
66	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN1 , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN2 , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
102	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN PROTEIN1 operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN2 
138	A low level of PROTEIN activated transcription of PROTEIN1 by PROTEIN RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of PROTEIN2 repressed PROTEIN transcription.
174	Expression of the PROTEIN1 dependent PROTEIN2 gene depended on PROTEIN 
210	DNase I footprinting showed that PROTEIN binds strongly to two sites in the PROTEIN1 promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the PROTEIN2 promoter, and does not bind specifically to PROTEIN 
246	The addition of PROTEIN1 to in vitro transcription reactions resulted in the stimulation of RNAP holoenzyme activity, but PROTEIN RNAP was observed to be more sensitive to PROTEIN dependent stimulation than PROTEIN2 RNAP.
282	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN1 PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
318	PROTEIN negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN1 thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN2 antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN activity.
