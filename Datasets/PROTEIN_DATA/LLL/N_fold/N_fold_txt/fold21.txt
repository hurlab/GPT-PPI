21	Northern blot and primer extension analyses indicated that PROTEIN1 is transcribed by PROTEIN2 during sporulation.
57	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN1 , flotillin ( PROTEIN2 , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
93	The PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN2 and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
129	A low level of PROTEIN1 activated transcription of PROTEIN by PROTEIN2 RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of PROTEIN repressed PROTEIN transcription.
165	Furthermore, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN seemed to be induced after phosphate starvation in the wild type in a PROTEIN dependent manner and in the sigB mutant probably via PROTEIN2 
201	Both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 were essential for PROTEIN expression, and this gene was transcribed from T5 of sporulation.
237	A low concentration of PROTEIN activated PROTEIN1 transcription by final PROTEIN2 RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN or PROTEIN 
273	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN1 PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
309	PROTEIN1 negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN2 activity.
