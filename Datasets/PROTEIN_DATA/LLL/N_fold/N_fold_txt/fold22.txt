22	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
58	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN1 and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN2 , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
94	The PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
130	A low level of PROTEIN1 activated transcription of PROTEIN by PROTEIN RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of PROTEIN repressed PROTEIN2 transcription.
166	Furthermore, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 seemed to be induced after phosphate starvation in the wild type in a PROTEIN dependent manner and in the sigB mutant probably via PROTEIN 
202	Both PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 were essential for PROTEIN2 expression, and this gene was transcribed from T5 of sporulation.
238	A low concentration of PROTEIN1 activated PROTEIN2 transcription by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN or PROTEIN 
274	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
310	PROTEIN1 negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN2 by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN activity.
