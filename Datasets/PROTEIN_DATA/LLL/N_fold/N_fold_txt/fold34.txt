34	PROTEIN1 also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN2 stress response sigma factor.
70	The PROTEIN1 regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN2 , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
106	The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of PROTEIN depends on the cell division protein PROTEIN1 and could correspond to the PROTEIN dependent assembly of PROTEIN2 into E-rings.
142	A PROTEIN1 dependent promoter (PW) precedes PROTEIN2 demonstrating that this transcription factor is positively autoregulated.
178	Three new PROTEIN1 dependent genes ( PROTEIN2 PROTEIN and PROTEIN encoding proteins with still unknown functions were also described.
214	DNase I footprinting showed that PROTEIN binds strongly to two sites in the PROTEIN1 promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the PROTEIN promoter, and does not bind specifically to PROTEIN2 
250	The addition of PROTEIN1 to in vitro transcription reactions resulted in the stimulation of RNAP holoenzyme activity, but PROTEIN RNAP was observed to be more sensitive to PROTEIN2 dependent stimulation than PROTEIN RNAP.
286	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
322	The Bacillus subtilis PROTEIN1 operon is regulated by two stress induction pathways relying on either PROTEIN or a class III stress induction mechanism acting at a PROTEIN2 like promoter.
