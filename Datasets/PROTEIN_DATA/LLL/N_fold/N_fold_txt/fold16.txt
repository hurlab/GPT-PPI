16	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN2 PROTEIN control region.
52	In this mutant, expression of the PROTEIN1 gene, whose transcription depends on both PROTEIN2 and the phosphorylated PROTEIN protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.
88	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN1 the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN2 and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
124	These results demonstrate that PROTEIN1 dependent transcription of PROTEIN2 initiates a negative feedback loop in which PROTEIN acts as a repressor to limit production of PROTEIN 
160	The expression of PROTEIN1 is under the control of both PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 
196	The PROTEIN promoter, like the PROTEIN1 promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN may inhibit PROTEIN2 activity late in sporulation.
232	A low concentration of PROTEIN activated PROTEIN1 transcription by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN2 or PROTEIN 
268	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN1 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
304	Secondly, PROTEIN1 is essential for the activation of the first compartment-specific transcription factor PROTEIN2 in the prespore.
