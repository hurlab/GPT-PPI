26	These results suggest that PROTEIN1 may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
62	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN1 , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN2 and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
98	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN2 PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
134	A low level of PROTEIN activated transcription of PROTEIN by PROTEIN1 RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of PROTEIN2 repressed PROTEIN transcription.
170	In vivo studies of the activity of four of the kinases, KinA, KinC, KinD (ykvD) and KinE (ykrQ), using abrB transcription as an indicator of Spo0A~P level, revealed that PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN were responsible for PROTEIN2 production during the exponential phase of growth in the absence of KinA and KinB.
206	From these results we conclude that PROTEIN1 negatively regulates PROTEIN expression by preventing PROTEIN2 driven transcription of PROTEIN possibly through interaction with the control region.
242	PROTEIN1 at low concentration repressed PROTEIN transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed PROTEIN2 transcription and had little effect on PROTEIN transcription.
278	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN2 
314	PROTEIN negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN1 by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN2 PROTEIN thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN activity.
