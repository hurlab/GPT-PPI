23	These results suggest that PROTEIN1 may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN2 PROTEIN and PROTEIN 
59	The PROTEIN1 regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN2 , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
95	The PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN2 
131	A low level of PROTEIN1 activated transcription of PROTEIN by PROTEIN RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of PROTEIN2 repressed PROTEIN transcription.
167	Furthermore, PROTEIN and PROTEIN seemed to be induced after phosphate starvation in the wild type in a PROTEIN1 dependent manner and in the sigB mutant probably via PROTEIN2 
203	From these results we conclude that PROTEIN1 negatively regulates PROTEIN2 expression by preventing PROTEIN driven transcription of PROTEIN possibly through interaction with the control region.
239	PROTEIN1 at low concentration repressed PROTEIN2 transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed PROTEIN transcription and had little effect on PROTEIN transcription.
275	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
311	PROTEIN1 negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN2 antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN activity.
