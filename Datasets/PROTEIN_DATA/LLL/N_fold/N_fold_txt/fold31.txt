31	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN1 PROTEIN PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 
67	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN1 , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN2 , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
103	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN2 and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
139	Here, we show that PROTEIN1 binds near the PROTEIN2 transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor.
175	Expression of the PROTEIN dependent PROTEIN1 gene depended on PROTEIN2 
211	DNase I footprinting showed that PROTEIN1 binds strongly to two sites in the PROTEIN promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the PROTEIN2 promoter, and does not bind specifically to PROTEIN 
247	The addition of PROTEIN to in vitro transcription reactions resulted in the stimulation of RNAP holoenzyme activity, but PROTEIN RNAP was observed to be more sensitive to PROTEIN1 dependent stimulation than PROTEIN2 RNAP.
283	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN1 PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN2 of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
319	PROTEIN negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN1 by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN2 activity.
