15	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN PROTEIN control region.
51	In this mutant, expression of the PROTEIN1 gene, whose transcription depends on both PROTEIN and the phosphorylated PROTEIN2 protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.
87	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN1 the PROTEIN PROTEIN2 operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
123	These results demonstrate that PROTEIN1 dependent transcription of PROTEIN initiates a negative feedback loop in which PROTEIN2 acts as a repressor to limit production of PROTEIN 
159	The expression of PROTEIN is under the control of both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 
195	The PROTEIN1 promoter, like the PROTEIN2 promoter, is believed to be recognized by PROTEIN RNA polymerase, suggesting that PROTEIN may inhibit PROTEIN activity late in sporulation.
231	A low concentration of PROTEIN1 activated PROTEIN transcription by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN2 or PROTEIN 
267	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN1 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
303	However, the mutant was unable to stimulate transcription by final PROTEIN1 RNA polymerase from the PROTEIN dependent PROTEIN2 operon promoter.
