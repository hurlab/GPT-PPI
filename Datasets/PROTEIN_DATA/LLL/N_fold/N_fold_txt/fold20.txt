20	In that respect PROTEIN is similar to the previously described gene PROTEIN1 which is also a member of the PROTEIN2 regulon.
56	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN1 , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN2 , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
92	The PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN PROTEIN2 operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN 
128	These results demonstrate that PROTEIN dependent transcription of PROTEIN1 initiates a negative feedback loop in which PROTEIN acts as a repressor to limit production of PROTEIN2 
164	Furthermore, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN seemed to be induced after phosphate starvation in the wild type in a PROTEIN2 dependent manner and in the sigB mutant probably via PROTEIN 
200	Both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN were essential for PROTEIN2 expression, and this gene was transcribed from T5 of sporulation.
236	A low concentration of PROTEIN1 activated PROTEIN transcription by final PROTEIN2 RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of PROTEIN or PROTEIN 
272	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN1 present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN2 which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
308	PROTEIN1 negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN2 thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN activity.
