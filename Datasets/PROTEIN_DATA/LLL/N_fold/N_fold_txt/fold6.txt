6	We demonstrated that PROTEIN1 is also a PROTEIN2 dependent general stress gene, since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy depletion.
42	The results indicate that PROTEIN is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN2 promoter.
78	The PROTEIN1 regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN2 , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
114	Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that PROTEIN1 blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated PROTEIN to activate PROTEIN2 until formation of the polar septum is completed.
150	This indicates that the PROTEIN gene product, being a member of both the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the PROTEIN2 regulon.
186	Production of PROTEIN1 about 1 h earlier than normal does affect PROTEIN which when phosphorylated is an activator of PROTEIN2 transcription.
222	Transcription of the PROTEIN PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 genes by final PROTEIN RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called PROTEIN2 
258	PROTEIN is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN an anti-anti-sigma factor, PROTEIN1 and a membrane-bound phosphatase, PROTEIN2 which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of PROTEIN back to the active form.
294	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN1 present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
330	Our data demonstrate that the PROTEIN protein acts as a global repressor of the PROTEIN1 operon, as well as other class III heat shock genes, by preventing unstressed transcription from either the PROTEIN or PROTEIN2 dependent promoter and might be inactivated or dissociate under inducing stress conditions.
