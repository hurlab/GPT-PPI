33	PROTEIN also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN1 a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN2 stress response sigma factor.
69	The PROTEIN regulon includes a penicillin binding protein ( PROTEIN1 and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase ( PROTEIN , homologues of signal peptide peptidase ( PROTEIN , flotillin ( PROTEIN2 , ABC transporters ( PROTEIN , non-haem bromoperoxidase ( PROTEIN , epoxide hydrolase ( PROTEIN and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
105	The PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, PROTEIN the PROTEIN PROTEIN operon is recognized equally well by PROTEIN and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN2 
141	These results suggest that a rising level of PROTEIN1 in sporulating cells may first activate PROTEIN2 transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.
177	The PROTEIN1 gene might belong to the increasing number of PROTEIN2 dependent genes whose orthologues are under the control of sigmas in Escherichia coli, indicating that both regulons may fulfil similar functions.
213	DNase I footprinting showed that PROTEIN1 binds strongly to two sites in the PROTEIN2 promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the PROTEIN promoter, and does not bind specifically to PROTEIN 
249	The addition of PROTEIN to in vitro transcription reactions resulted in the stimulation of RNAP holoenzyme activity, but PROTEIN1 RNAP was observed to be more sensitive to PROTEIN2 dependent stimulation than PROTEIN RNAP.
285	The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; PROTEIN1 present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor PROTEIN2 PROTEIN which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, PROTEIN and PROTEIN of Bacillus subtilis; PROTEIN of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor PROTEIN and PROTEIN a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor PROTEIN 
321	PROTEIN negatively controls the transcription of PROTEIN1 by stimulating the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN thereby increasing the production of the PROTEIN2 antisigma factor that inhibits PROTEIN activity.
