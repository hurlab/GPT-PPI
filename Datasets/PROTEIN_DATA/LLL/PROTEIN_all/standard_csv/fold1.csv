1,Our results indicate that the level of PROTEIN1 level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on PROTEIN2 because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores.,TRUE
2,"Therefore, the physiological role of PROTEIN1 dependent PROTEIN2 expression remains obscure.",TRUE
3,"The -10 and -35 sequences of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 dependent promoters of PROTEIN overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide.",FALSE
4,"The -10 and -35 sequences of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 dependent promoters of PROTEIN2 overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide.",TRUE
