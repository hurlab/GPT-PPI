1	Our results indicate that the level of PROTEIN1 level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on PROTEIN2 because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores.
2	Therefore, the physiological role of PROTEIN1 dependent PROTEIN2 expression remains obscure.
3	The -10 and -35 sequences of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 dependent promoters of PROTEIN overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide.
4	The -10 and -35 sequences of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 dependent promoters of PROTEIN2 overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide.
5	The -10 and -35 sequences of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN dependent promoters of PROTEIN2 overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide.
6	We demonstrated that PROTEIN1 is also a PROTEIN2 dependent general stress gene, since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy depletion.
7	The PROTEIN gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by PROTEIN1 containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression PROTEIN2 a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS).
8	The PROTEIN1 gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by PROTEIN2 containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression PROTEIN a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS).
9	The PROTEIN1 gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by PROTEIN containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression PROTEIN2 a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS).
10	Unlike the case for other PROTEIN1 dependent genes, PROTEIN2 has no UAS; instead, its expression depends on a sequence located 1.5 kilobases downstream of the rocG promoter, beyond the end of the rocG coding region.
11	In addition to controlling transcription of PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 appears to control expression of at least one other gene required for production of CSF.
12	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN PROTEIN2 control region.
13	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN PROTEIN2 control region.
14	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 control region.
15	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN PROTEIN control region.
16	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN2 PROTEIN control region.
17	We overproduced and purified sigma(X) from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that in vitro, both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN holoenzymes recognize promoter elements within the PROTEIN2 PROTEIN control region.
18	In that respect PROTEIN1 is similar to the previously described gene PROTEIN which is also a member of the PROTEIN2 regulon.
19	In that respect PROTEIN1 is similar to the previously described gene PROTEIN2 which is also a member of the PROTEIN regulon.
20	In that respect PROTEIN is similar to the previously described gene PROTEIN1 which is also a member of the PROTEIN2 regulon.
