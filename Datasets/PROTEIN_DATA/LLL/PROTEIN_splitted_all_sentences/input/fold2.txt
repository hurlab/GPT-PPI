21	Northern blot and primer extension analyses indicated that PROTEIN1 is transcribed by PROTEIN2 during sporulation.
22	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
23	These results suggest that PROTEIN1 may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN2 PROTEIN and PROTEIN 
24	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN1 PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 
25	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 PROTEIN and PROTEIN 
26	These results suggest that PROTEIN1 may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
27	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 
28	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN1 PROTEIN PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN 
29	These results suggest that PROTEIN1 may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN PROTEIN PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 
30	These results suggest that PROTEIN1 may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN2 PROTEIN PROTEIN and PROTEIN 
31	These results suggest that PROTEIN may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of PROTEIN1 PROTEIN PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 
32	PROTEIN1 also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN2 a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN stress response sigma factor.
33	PROTEIN also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN1 a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN2 stress response sigma factor.
34	PROTEIN1 also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN2 stress response sigma factor.
35	The expression of the PROTEIN1 operon was induced by the presence of isoleucine or valine in the growth medium and depended upon the presence of the sigma factor PROTEIN2 a member of the sigma 54 family.
36	Transcriptional studies demonstrated that the expression from the PROTEIN1 promoter is induced by L-arabinose, repressed by glucose, and negatively regulated by PROTEIN2 
37	Although PROTEIN1 is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the PROTEIN2 phosphorelay, there is considerable evidence implicating a mechanism of post-translational control that governs the activity and concentration of sigmaH.
