32	PROTEIN1 also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN2 a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN stress response sigma factor.	True
33	PROTEIN also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN1 a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN2 stress response sigma factor.	True
34	PROTEIN1 also contributes to the expression of PROTEIN a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the PROTEIN2 stress response sigma factor.	False
35	The expression of the PROTEIN1 operon was induced by the presence of isoleucine or valine in the growth medium and depended upon the presence of the sigma factor PROTEIN2 a member of the sigma 54 family.	True
36	Transcriptional studies demonstrated that the expression from the PROTEIN1 promoter is induced by L-arabinose, repressed by glucose, and negatively regulated by PROTEIN2 	True
37	Although PROTEIN1 is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the PROTEIN2 phosphorelay, there is considerable evidence implicating a mechanism of post-translational control that governs the activity and concentration of sigmaH.	True
