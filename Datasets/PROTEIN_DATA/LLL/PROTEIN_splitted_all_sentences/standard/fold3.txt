38	PROTEIN1 transcription also requires the DNA binding protein PROTEIN2 	True
39	In contrast, PROTEIN1 is transcribed in the forespore compartment by RNA polymerase with the forespore-specific PROTEIN2 and appears to give a monocistronic transcript.	True
40	Transcriptional studies showed that PROTEIN1 is strongly induced in response to heat, ethanol and salt stress or after starvation for glucose in a PROTEIN2 dependent manner.	True
41	The results indicate that PROTEIN1 is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN promoter.	True
42	The results indicate that PROTEIN is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN2 promoter.	False
43	The results indicate that PROTEIN is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN promoter.	False
44	The results indicate that PROTEIN1 is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN and PROTEIN promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN2 promoter.	True
45	The results indicate that PROTEIN1 is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN promoter.	True
46	The results indicate that PROTEIN is sufficient to repress the transcription of the PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN promoters and also to activate the transcription of the PROTEIN2 promoter.	False
47	During endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis, the DNA binding protein PROTEIN1 stimulates transcription from several promoters that are used by RNA polymerase containing PROTEIN2 	True
48	PROTEIN1 binds to a site on one of these promoters, PROTEIN2 that overlaps its -35 region.	True
49	Finally, we show that proper localization of SpoIVA required the expression of one or more genes which, like PROTEIN1 are under the control of the mother cell transcription factor PROTEIN2 	True
