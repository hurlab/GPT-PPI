IEPA.d129.s309	We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system
IEPA.d129.s310	Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control
IEPA.d129.s311	However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics
IEPA.d149.s362	Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and leptin produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in neuropeptide Y expression
IEPA.d150.s363	Possible central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms could mediate these responses in that leptin receptors are located on hypothalamic neurons that coexpress neuropeptide-Y (NPY) or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and both peptides that have been implicated as mediators of the CNS action of leptin.
IEPA.d150.s364	Leptin has been demonstrated to decrease or down regulate NPY expression and increase POMC expression
IEPA.d153.s369	Interestingly, both 5-HT and leptin modulate the action of NPY, which may form a part of a common output pathway for the expression of appetite
IEPA.d157.s374	We have studied the effects of neomycin, a potent inhibitor of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), on the germination of rice seed and the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and the scutellar tissues
IEPA.d157.s375	It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in both secretory tissues
IEPA.d157.s376	These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed
IEPA.d163.s395	C75 inhibited expression of the prophagic signal neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus and acted in a leptin-independent manner that appears to be mediated by malonyl-coenzyme A
IEPA.d165.s397	Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue
IEPA.d165.s398	The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization
IEPA.d165.s399	The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats
IEPA.d165.s400	At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed
IEPA.d165.s401	Summing up, new evidence suggests that NPY and leptin may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level
IEPA.d191.s459	Similarly, central leptin treatment also had a greater effect in suppressing hypothalamic NPY mRNA expression in young (-23+/-4%) than in old (-8+/-4%) rats compared with their age-matched pair-fed treated rats
IEPA.d5.s8	Oxytocin-stimulated inositol phosphate turnover in endometrium of ewes is influenced by stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins
IEPA.d5.s9	Three experiments (Exp) assessed the influence of stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins (oCSP) on turnover of inositol trisphosphate (the putative second-messenger for oxytocin-stimulated secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha) in ovine endometrium during luteolysis and maternal recognition of pregnancy
IEPA.d5.s10	For each Exp, 100 mg endometrium was incubated, in duplicate, for 2 h with 10 microCi [3H] inositol and treated with 0 or 100 nM oxytocin (OT) for 20 min, then [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (IP1, IP2, and IP3, respectively) were quantified
IEPA.d30.s62	The influence of myrigalone B, a flavonoid from the fruit exudate of Myrica gale L. on Cu(2+)-induced oxidation of low density lipoprotein from cholesterol fed rabbits was investigated
IEPA.d53.s137	During luteinization of bovine granulosa cells in vitro in the presence of insulin, or insulin plus forskolin, there is a massive upregulation not only of progesterone production, but also of the gene for the peptide hormone oxytocin, with secretion of the peptide into the medium
IEPA.d110.s264	Signal transduction of arginine vasopressin-induced arachidonic acid release in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts: role of Ca2+ and the protein kinase C-dependent activation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase
IEPA.d110.s265	The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 or ionomycin, mimicked the effect of AVP, whereas the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, TPA, only induced a slight increase in AA release
IEPA.d110.s266	Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PKC inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the AVP-induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms
IEPA.d110.s267	AVP- or TPA-induced activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK were completely blocked by down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta, but still occurred, together with the cytosolic PLA2 mobility shift, in the absence of external Ca2+
IEPA.d110.s268	These results show that AVP-induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta
IEPA.d124.s297	By comparison with the promoters of alpha-amylase genes, which are also induced by GA, we suggest that GARE is coupled with the upstream element and the pyrimidine box to form a GA response complex
