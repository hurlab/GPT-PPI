IEPA.d114.s274	In normal pancreatic islets, UCP-2 is upregulated by leptin and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats
IEPA.d114.s275	To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive UCP-2-underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the UCP-2 gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats
IEPA.d114.s276	We conclude that UCP-2 has uncoupling function when overexpressed in leptin-insensitive islets and that its overexpression corrects the underexpression of the insulin gene and ameliorates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, possibly by increasing the ATP:ADP ratio
IEPA.d117.s285	The second class of mutant, gse (GA sensitivity), differed principally in GA sensitivity, requiring approximately 100-fold higher [GA3] for both leaf elongation and alpha-amylase production by aleurone
IEPA.d133.s321	Neurotransmitters and hormones, such as arginine vasopressin (AVP) and bombesin, evoke frequency-modulated repetitive Ca2+ transients in insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells by binding to receptors linked to phospholipase C (PLC)
IEPA.d138.s327	Insulin-like signaling in yeast: modulation of protein phosphatase 2A, protein kinase A, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activities
IEPA.d138.s328	In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC
IEPA.d138.s329	GPI-PLC was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human insulin compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I
IEPA.d138.s330	As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone
IEPA.d138.s331	The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation
IEPA.d138.s332	The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase
IEPA.d154.s370	The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored protein, membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) is released from the surface of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin treatment through the action of a phospholipase C
IEPA.d154.s371	Although X-Pro aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.9) is GPI-anchored in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as shown by digestion with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, it was not released upon insulin treatment of the cells, indicating that only a subset of the GPI-anchored proteins are susceptible to insulin-stimulated release
IEPA.d173.s419	We have established that the recovery of secreted N1 is increased by the protein kinase C agonists PDBu and PMA in a time- and dose-dependent manner in both cell lines
IEPA.d173.s420	In contrast, secretion of N1 remains unaffected by the inactive PDBu analog alphaPDD and by the protein kinase A effectors dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin
IEPA.d173.s421	Overall, our data indicate that the normal processing of PrP(c) is up-regulated by protein kinase C but not protein kinase A in human cells and murine neurons
IEPA.d178.s429	A caveolin-1-dependent coupling of PrPc to the tyrosine kinase Fyn was observed
IEPA.d179.s430	Recently several significant advances have been made in this area, including the identification of the appetite regulating hormone, leptin, and a detailed understanding of its targets in the central nervous system (CNS), such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the melanocortin-4 receptor
IEPA.d181.s435	Activity and expression of the three UCP's are stimulated by several neuromediators and hormones such as noradrenaline, tri-iodothyronine and leptin
IEPA.d59.s154	PKB, which is an important early PI 3-kinase-dependent component of insulin signalling pathways, is also down-regulated by PLC-coupled agonists
IEPA.d78.s187	To assess the possible involvement of PKC in AVP and IL-1 action in Leydig cells, the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C was tested
IEPA.d78.s188	These results confirm that AVP and PMA activate PKC and indicate that IL-1 likely does not activate PKC in Leydig cells
