IEPA.d161.s386	Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion
IEPA.d161.s387	Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia
IEPA.d161.s388	Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion
IEPA.d161.s389	These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins
IEPA.d169.s409	The body mass index (BMI), leptin, plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY), serotonin, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) in serum were evaluated for each subject
IEPA.d174.s422	Dietary intakes of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones by Japanese women and the inverse correlation between quercetin intake and plasma LDL cholesterol concentration
IEPA.d174.s423	The total intake of flavonoids was inversely correlated with the plasma total cholesterol concentration (TC) (r = -0.236, P: < 0.05) and plasma LDL cholesterol concentration (LDL-C) (r = -0.220, P: < 0.05), after the adjustment for age, body mass index and total energy intake
IEPA.d29.s61	This action of beta-amyloid 25-35 is not altered by pretreatment with the calcium channel blockers nifedipine or cobalt, with the depleter of intracellular calcium stores cyclopiazonic acid, or with the phospholipase C inhibitor neomycin
IEPA.d42.s103	Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway
IEPA.d42.s104	The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system
IEPA.d42.s105	When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion
IEPA.d42.s106	Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose
IEPA.d42.s107	When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release
IEPA.d46.s115	Amyloid beta protein (25-35) stimulation of phospholipase C in LA-N-2 cells
IEPA.d46.s116	This phospholipase C stimulation by amyloid beta protein appeared to be pertussis toxin sensitive
IEPA.d46.s117	It is possible that this phospholipase C stimulation by amyloid beta protein is a receptor-mediated process
IEPA.d46.s118	Amyloid beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C was absent from LA-N-2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or amyloid beta peptide
IEPA.d46.s119	It is suggested that this observed amyloid beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C may be responsible for the elevated quantity of inositol seen in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients
IEPA.d51.s133	Insulin stimulates the release of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane dipeptidase from 3T3-L1 adipocytes through the action of a phospholipase C
IEPA.d51.s134	The hydrophilic form of MDP released from the cells on stimulation with insulin was recognized by antibodies against the inositol 1,2-cyclic monophosphate cross-reacting determinant, indicating that it had been generated by cleavage of its GPI anchor through the action of a phospholipase C
IEPA.d136.s324	The etiology for diabetes mellitus in PWS may be related to the morbid obesity and consequent insulin resistance, because a decrease of oxytocin neurons and leptin resistance in PWS may cause hyperphagia, inducing obesity
IEPA.d167.s403	Pretreatment of HEK-293 cells for 2 min with carbachol, a mAChR agonist, lysophosphatidic acid, or ATP, followed by agonist washout, strongly increased (by 2-3-fold) maximal PLC stimulation (measured >/=40 min later) by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, but not insulin, and largely enhanced PLC sensitivity to these RTK agonists
