IEPA.d130.s312	Amyloid beta peptide 25-35 modulates hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by membrane phospholipase(s) C of adult brain cortex
IEPA.d130.s313	Fresh-water-soluble A beta 25-35 activated PI-PLC in SPM markedly by two- to threefold, but this effect was absent in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2
IEPA.d130.s314	Moreover, A beta 25-35 had no effect on basal PIP2-PLC activity and cytosolic PI-PLC and PIP2-PLC
IEPA.d130.s315	The aggregated form of A beta 25-35 significantly inhibited PIP2-PLC only in the presence of endogenous CaCl2
IEPA.d144.s345	Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and its neuroendocrine regulation by leptin
IEPA.d151.s365	Relationship among leptin, neuropeptide Y, and galanin in young women and in postmenopausal women [see comments]
IEPA.d151.s366	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormonal status may affect neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin, and leptin release in postmenopausal women and in young women
IEPA.d151.s367	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, NPY, and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher NPY levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved
IEPA.d160.s385	Thus, highly expressed in human adipocytes, the Y(1) receptor sustains the strong antilipolytic effect of NPY and exerts a positive action on leptin secretion
IEPA.d177.s426	As expected, in fusion of NPY alone (18 microg/day) augmented food intake (191.6% over the initial control, P < 0.05) and produced a 25.1% weight gain in conjunction with a 10-fold increase in serum leptin concentrations at the end of the 7-day period
IEPA.d177.s427	Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of NPY with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum leptin concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression
IEPA.d177.s428	These results demonstrate that chronic central infusion to produce a persistent elevation of the cytokine at pathophysiological levels (a situation that may normally manifest during infection, injury and inflammation) produced severe anorexia and weight loss in conjunction with reduction in both serum leptin concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression
IEPA.d185.s442	The ARC NPY neurones are stimulated by starvation, probably mediated by falls in circulating leptin and insulin (which both inhibit these neurones), and contribute to the increased hunger in this and other conditions of energy deficit
IEPA.d185.s443	ARC NPY neurones also mediate hyperphagia and obesity in the ob/ob and db/db mice and fa/fa rat, in which leptin inhibition is lost through mutations affecting leptin or its receptor
IEPA.d196.s476	Both receive information about the nutritional status and the level of energy storage through insulin and leptin signaling mediated by specific receptors located on POMC and NPY neurons present predominantly in the arcuate nucleus (ARC).
IEPA.d196.s477	When leptin signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the NPY system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished.
IEPA.d69.s170	During wk 6, milk yield and dry matter intake (DMI) were recorded daily, and plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, urea, protein, growth hormone, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, oxytocin, and prolactin were determined
IEPA.d75.s179	Concurrent decrease of vasopressin and protein kinase Calpha immunoreactivity during the light phase in the vole suprachiasmatic nucleus
IEPA.d75.s180	Mean numbers of AVP- and protein kinase Calpha-immunoreactive neurons were determined in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of common voles, entrained to a 12:12 h light-dark (LD) cycle, at the beginning of the light period (zeitgeber time zero) and 6 h later (zeitgeber time six)
IEPA.d75.s181	At zeitgeber time zero, mean numbers of AVP- and protein kinase Calpha- immunoreactive neurons were 2194 and 9897, respectively
IEPA.d95.s229	The distribution of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) cells in the SCN overlapped with that of PKC in both species
IEPA.d95.s230	Species differences in the location of the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms suggest differences in function such as the relaying of photic or non-photic information to the clock mechanism, or the synchronization of AVP neurons and their subsequent output signals
IEPA.d101.s240	The two groups were similar in their morning thyroxin, triiodothyronine, TSH, estradiol, cortisol, gastrin, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, oxytocin, insulin and IGF-1 levels
IEPA.d105.s244	The deduced consensus closely resembled gibberellin response elements in alpha-amylase promoters
