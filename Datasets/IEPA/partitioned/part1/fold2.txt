IEPA.d10.s22	Amyloid beta protein disruption of cholinergic and growth factor phospholipase C signals could underlie cognitive and neurodegerative aspects of Alzheimer's disease
IEPA.d15.s32	The beta amyloid protein fragments had diverse effects on phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) as assayed in rat cortical membranes
IEPA.d22.s46	Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular prion protein isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a prion protein-specific kinase
IEPA.d25.s54	The responses of serum oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) to the serotonergic HT1A agonist buspirone (15 mg p.o.) or the HTD1 agonist sumatriptan (6 mg injected subcutaneously) were evaluated in 7 normal men either in basal conditions or during an insulin (0.15 iu/kg as an i.v. bolus) tolerance test (ITT)
IEPA.d25.s55	Stimulation of 5HT-1D receptors with sumatriptan was unable to change neither AVP nor OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia
IEPA.d43.s108	Induction by leptin of uncoupling protein-2 and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation
IEPA.d43.s109	Here we show that leptin alters in pancreatic islets the mRNA of the genes encoding enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2)
IEPA.d43.s110	Leptin overexpression increased UCP-2 mRNA by more than 10-fold in epididymal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat tissue of normal, but not of leptin-receptor-defective obese rats
IEPA.d43.s111	By directly regulating the expression of enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and of UCP-2, leptin controls intracellular triglyceride content of certain nonadipocytes, as well as adipocytes
IEPA.d60.s155	The activity of the MAPKs, induced by AVP or PMA was inhibited by downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC), by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059
IEPA.d60.s156	We suggest that AVP activates the 42/44kDa MAPKs through a signal transduction pathway that involves stimulation of AVP-V1 receptor, tyrosine kinase, PKC and MEK
IEPA.d72.s173	Treatment with (+)-trifluoro-ABA strongly inhibited the gibberellic acid-inducible expression of alpha-amylase I-1 encoded by RAmy1A in the aleurone layers of embryoless half-seeds at the levels of transcription, protein synthesis, and enzyme activity
IEPA.d74.s176	Chronic central leptin infusion enhances insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and favors the expression of uncoupling proteins
IEPA.d74.s177	In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular leptin administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 expression in all these tissues
IEPA.d74.s178	While leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms (UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats
IEPA.d76.s182	Melatonin inhibits oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but not to angiotensin II in normal men
IEPA.d76.s183	In order to establish whether melatonin alters basal and/or stimulated oxytocin secretion, 18 normal men were treated (p.o.) with 6 or 12 mg melatonin or placebo in basal conditions (N-6 subjects) or concomitantly to the administration of insulin (O.15 IU/kg body weight in an i.v. bolus) (N-6 subjects) or angiotensin II (increasing doses of 4, 8 and 16 ng/kg/min, at intervals of 20 min)
IEPA.d76.s184	In contrast, the oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was significantly reduced by melatonin treatment
IEPA.d84.s199	Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics
IEPA.d84.s200	Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion
IEPA.d84.s201	DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion
IEPA.d84.s202	Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min
IEPA.d84.s203	CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous insulin secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the OT secretory system in IDDM
