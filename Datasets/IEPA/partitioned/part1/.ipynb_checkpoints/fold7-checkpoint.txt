IEPA.d11.s23	Amyloid beta protein (25-35) stimulation of phospholipases A, C and D activities of LA-N-2 cells
IEPA.d11.s24	[3H]Inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of A beta P, from 20 to 125 micrograms/ml, and phospholipase C activation was measured
IEPA.d11.s25	The effects of adrenergic, metabotropic amino acid and bombesin antagonists on the A beta P mediated stimulation of phospholipase C activity was investigated
IEPA.d11.s26	Propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, a metabotropic amino acid antagonist, and [Tyr4-D-Phe12]bombesin, a bombesin antagonist, blunted the A beta P stimulation of phospholipase C activity in [3H]inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells
IEPA.d11.s27	This suggests that amyloid beta protein activation of phospholipase C may be receptor mediated
IEPA.d11.s28	The phospholipase C inhibitor U 71322 prevented the activation of phospholipase C by A beta P
IEPA.d12.s29	These results suggest that APP-S secretion and A beta production in NT2N neurons are regulated by the muscarinic/phospholipase C signal transduction pathway
IEPA.d13.s30	Current interest in reducing heart disease risks by diet involves attention to total fat; saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans fatty acids, as well as dietary cholesterol, soluble fiber, salt, alcohol, antioxidants, dietary alterations causing homocysteinemia and other dietary constituents, such as flavonoid compounds in some soy products
IEPA.d21.s45	These data suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at a step involving GTP-binding protein/PLC coupling can exert a negative effect on the stimulation of IP3 formation by oxytocin and thereby affect contraction/relaxation in the myometrium
IEPA.d40.s96	Roles of GTP and phospholipase C in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets
IEPA.d40.s97	There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment PLC activity bore no relationship to the secretory response
IEPA.d40.s98	MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, insulin secretion was only inhibited (by 46%) in primed islets
IEPA.d40.s99	These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion
IEPA.d41.s100	Regulation of insulin secretion via ATP-sensitive K+ channel independent mechanisms: role of phospholipase C
IEPA.d41.s101	The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of phospholipase C distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of insulin secretion from mouse but not rat islets
IEPA.d41.s102	The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated phospholipase C isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different insulin secretory responses under these unique conditions
IEPA.d44.s112	Further, the oxytocin-induced activation of IK(sl) was effectively antagonized by 5 x 10(-8) mol/l U-73122 or 5 x 10(-6) mol/l 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate (inhibitors of the cell membrane phospholipase C), as well as by intracellularly applied heparin (selective inhibitor of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release channels)
IEPA.d44.s113	The data obtained suggest (i) that selective oxytocin receptors are present on the membranes of guinea-pig antral smooth muscle cells, (ii) that the oxytocin-related relaxation may result from the activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ conductivity via activation of IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from the submembrane located cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and (iii) in turn, this evokes a non-inactivating component of IK, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane
IEPA.d88.s207	To elucidate the pathophysiologic significance of UCP3 and UCP2 in the effect of TZDs on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure, we examined their basal mRNA levels in the WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle from Wistar fatty rats, a rat model of NIDDM and obesity with leptin receptor defect, and investigated expression of the genes encoding UCP3 and UCP2 in Wistar fatty rats and in Wistar lean rats with 2-week oral administration of 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pioglitazone, a TZD derivative
IEPA.d88.s208	These results clearly demonstrate that UCP3 gene expression is upregulated by TZDs in the WAT and BAT in Wistar fatty rats, an obese model with leptin receptor defect, and that adipose UCP3 gene expression is increased in response to TZDs in vitro
IEPA.d99.s237	Enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis via overexpression of phospholipase C beta1 or delta1 inhibits stimulus-induced insulin release in insulinoma MIN6 cells.
IEPA.d99.s238	To study the effects of enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis on insulin secretion, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1) or PLCdelta1 was overexpressed in insulinoma MIN6 cells via adenoviral vectors.
