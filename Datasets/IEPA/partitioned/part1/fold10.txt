IEPA.d20.s42	We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion
IEPA.d20.s43	Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT
IEPA.d20.s44	These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs
IEPA.d23.s47	The resulting abnormally phosphorylated PrPsc aggregates to freshly synthesized PrPc, transforming it into same; due to a system of positive feedback invoked by the organophosphate-induced blockage of a prion protein-specific protein kinase.
IEPA.d31.s63	OT may rapidly stimulate inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, consistent with the concept of rapid activation of a second-messenger system
IEPA.d31.s64	In support of this hypothesis, endometrial IP3 levels were increased (P < 0.05) within 0.5 min after treatment with 0.1 microM OT
IEPA.d31.s65	These results indicate that OT induces endometrial IP3 production in a rapid manner indicative of a second-messenger system
IEPA.d38.s92	2) IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin also induced a Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum: phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors, neomycin, or U-73122 partially blocked the intracellular [Ca2+]i increase induced by IGF-1 and insulin and totally inhibited the effect of IGF-2
IEPA.d48.s123	Leptin increases uncoupling protein expression and energy expenditure
IEPA.d48.s124	Leptin increased BAT UCP mRNA levels greater than twofold in both ad libitum-fed and food-restricted rats
IEPA.d48.s125	These data demonstrate a leptin-induced increase in energy expenditure in nonmutant rodents and suggest that one mechanism by which leptin increases energy expenditure is through increased thermogenesis in BAT, including increased expression of UCP
IEPA.d52.s135	Uncoupling protein-3 is a mediator of thermogenesis regulated by thyroid hormone, beta3-adrenergic agonists, and leptin
IEPA.d52.s136	UCP3 mRNA levels were also regulated by dexamethasone, leptin, and starvation, albeit differently in muscle and brown adipose tissue
IEPA.d61.s157	Secreted form of beta-amyloid precursor protein activates protein kinase C and phospholipase Cgamma1 in cultured embryonic rat neocortical cells
IEPA.d61.s158	Furthermore, we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma1 and formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were increased by sAPP695-stimulation
IEPA.d100.s239	If daily oxytocin injections are repeated over a 5-day period, blood pressure is decreased by 10-20 mmHg, the withdrawal latency to heat stimuli is prolonged, cortisol levels are decreased and insulin and cholecystokinin levels are increased
IEPA.d109.s256	Fasting and leptin modulate adipose and muscle uncoupling protein: divergent effects between messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression
IEPA.d109.s257	In this study, we examined the effects of fasting for 2 days and exogenous s.c. leptin, 200 microg every 8 h for 2 days, on the regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) subtypes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gastrocnemius muscle
IEPA.d109.s258	Leptin, compared with vehicle, did not alter BAT UCP-1 or UCP-3 mRNA or protein expression when administered to normal ad libitum fed rats
IEPA.d109.s259	Fasting significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 and UCP-3 mRNA expression, to 31% and 30% of ad libitum fed controls, respectively, effects which were prevented by administration of leptin to fasted rats
IEPA.d109.s260	Fasting also significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 protein expression, to 67% of control; however, that effect was not prevented by leptin treatment
IEPA.d109.s261	Fasting, with or without leptin administration, did not affect BAT UCP-2 mRNA; however, leptin administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT UCP-2 mRNA, to 138% of control
IEPA.d109.s262	Fasting significantly enhanced gastrocnemius muscle UCP-3 mRNA (411% of control) and protein expression (168% of control), whereas leptin administration to fasted rats did not alter either of these effects
IEPA.d109.s263	In summary, UCP subtype mRNA and protein are regulated in tissue- and subtype-specific fashion by leptin and food restriction
