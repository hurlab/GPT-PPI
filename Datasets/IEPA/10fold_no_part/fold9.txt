IEPA.d130.s314	Moreover, A beta 25-35 had no effect on basal PIP2-PLC activity and cytosolic PI-PLC and PIP2-PLC
IEPA.d130.s315	The aggregated form of A beta 25-35 significantly inhibited PIP2-PLC only in the presence of endogenous CaCl2
IEPA.d144.s345	Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and its neuroendocrine regulation by leptin
IEPA.d151.s365	Relationship among leptin, neuropeptide Y, and galanin in young women and in postmenopausal women [see comments]
IEPA.d151.s366	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormonal status may affect neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin, and leptin release in postmenopausal women and in young women
IEPA.d151.s367	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, NPY, and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher NPY levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved
IEPA.d160.s385	Thus, highly expressed in human adipocytes, the Y(1) receptor sustains the strong antilipolytic effect of NPY and exerts a positive action on leptin secretion
IEPA.d177.s426	As expected, in fusion of NPY alone (18 microg/day) augmented food intake (191.6% over the initial control, P < 0.05) and produced a 25.1% weight gain in conjunction with a 10-fold increase in serum leptin concentrations at the end of the 7-day period
IEPA.d177.s427	Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of NPY with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum leptin concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression
IEPA.d177.s428	These results demonstrate that chronic central infusion to produce a persistent elevation of the cytokine at pathophysiological levels (a situation that may normally manifest during infection, injury and inflammation) produced severe anorexia and weight loss in conjunction with reduction in both serum leptin concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression
IEPA.d185.s442	The ARC NPY neurones are stimulated by starvation, probably mediated by falls in circulating leptin and insulin (which both inhibit these neurones), and contribute to the increased hunger in this and other conditions of energy deficit
