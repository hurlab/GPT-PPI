IEPA.d122.s291	Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs)
IEPA.d122.s292	To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured
IEPA.d122.s293	I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen.
IEPA.d122.s294	Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively
IEPA.d122.s295	These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism
