IEPA.d107.s247	Molecular characterization of catalytic-subunit cDNA sequences encoding protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and study of their roles in the gibberellin-dependent Osamy-c expression in rice
IEPA.d107.s248	To understand the molecular mechanism of gibberellin-dependent gene regulation, the effect of three phosphatase inhibitors on the germination of rice seeds and the expression of a target gene, the alpha-amylase gene, Osamy-c, were measured
IEPA.d107.s249	To further understand the possible role of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in the GA-dependent expression of Osamy-c, we isolated cDNA clones encoding protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A from a rice aleurone cDNA library
IEPA.d107.s250	Taken together, our results suggest that protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A are involved in the GA-dependent expression of the rice Osamy-c gene, though the PP1 or/and PP2A enzymatic activities as well as mRNA levels do not increase upon GA3 treatment
IEPA.d127.s301	PI-PLC treatment of fetal guinea pig brain cultures substantially reduced the amount of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the medium but had no effect on sAPPalpha
IEPA.d127.s302	When this parental line was treated with PI-PLC, Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of PI-PLC
IEPA.d131.s316	Vasopressin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation by activation of PKC in the rat smooth muscle cell line, A-10
IEPA.d131.s317	The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors: staurosporine, H7 and GF109203X are able to block the AVP-stimulated phosphorylation
IEPA.d131.s318	These results indicate that PKC is upstream of the phosphorylation, a motion which is supported by the fact that the AVP-stimulated phosphorylation was downregulated by phorbol esters
IEPA.d147.s357	Ten protein kinases have been assayed for their ability to phosphorylate in vitro the recombinant bovine PrP (25-242) (rbPrP)
IEPA.d147.s358	With regard to CK2, phosphorylation occurs at Ser 154 with a stoichiometry of about 0.1 mol phosphate/mol rbPrP, which is doubled by mild heat treatment of rbPrP
IEPA.d159.s382	In the fasting state UCP-2 expression correlated inversely with body mass index (r = -0.45; P = 0.026), percent body fat (r = -0.41; P = 0.05), plasma insulin (r = -0.47; P = 0.02), epigastric venous fatty acids (r = -0.45; P = 0.04), and leptin (r = -0.50; P = 0.018)
IEPA.d159.s383	UCP-2 expression remained inversely related with plasma leptin after controlling for percent body (r = -0.45; P = 0.038)
IEPA.d159.s384	In conclusion, 1) UCP-2 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in sc adipose tissue is inversely related to adiposity and independently linked to local plasma leptin levels; and 2) UCP-2 expression is not acutely regulated by food intake, insulin, or fatty acids
IEPA.d180.s431	A loop system exists between hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peripheral adipose tissue leptin to maintain normal body homeostasis
IEPA.d180.s432	When infused i.c.v. to normal rats to mimic its central effects, leptin decreases NPY levels, thus food intake and body weight
IEPA.d180.s433	Circadian fluctuations of NPY and leptin levels maintain normal body homeostasis
IEPA.d180.s434	Leptin increases the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCP-1, -2, -3) and thus energy dissipation
