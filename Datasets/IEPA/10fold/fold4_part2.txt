IEPA.d113.s273	The low-performing Stock B animals were characterized by [1] being more reactive to sensory stimulation: higher startle amplitude and shorter startle latency; [2] having higher plasma insulin and corticosterone levels, whereas plasma gastrin and oxytocin were significantly lowered and a strong tendency for a decrease also in plasma CCK
IEPA.d126.s299	The expression of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT leptin mRNA expression and exogenous administration of leptin resulted in induction of the uterine UCP2 and UCP3 levels
IEPA.d126.s300	These results indicate that UCP gene expressions during pregnancy are regulated tissue-dependently, and up-regulation of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA may be due to increased leptin levels
IEPA.d140.s335	Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells
IEPA.d140.s336	However, AVP-induced activation of RSK2, a downstream substrate of ERK1 and ERK2, was PKC-dependent and PI 3-kinase-independent
IEPA.d140.s337	PKC was necessary in AVP- but not in LPA-induced activation of p70 S6K
IEPA.d143.s343	Oxytocin central injections to intact animals stimulated insulin synthesis and secretion without changing of islets area
IEPA.d143.s344	Thus, oxytocin administration stimulates insulin synthesis and secretion in intact and diabetic animals and this effect is more expressed with central injections
IEPA.d162.s390	We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats
IEPA.d162.s391	These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age
IEPA.d162.s392	We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus
IEPA.d162.s393	Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats
IEPA.d162.s394	These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels
IEPA.d166.s402	The protein kinase C specific inhibitor Go-6983 further enhanced the inhibitory effect of VACM-1 on AVP-stimulated cAMP production
IEPA.d168.s404	Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle
IEPA.d168.s405	A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3
IEPA.d168.s406	To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle
IEPA.d168.s407	It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls
IEPA.d168.s408	These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression
IEPA.d182.s436	The effect of leptin in adult rats appears to be exerted at hypothalamic level by regulating growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-producing neurones
