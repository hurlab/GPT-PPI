IEPA.d74.s178	While leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms (UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats
IEPA.d76.s182	Melatonin inhibits oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but not to angiotensin II in normal men
IEPA.d76.s183	In order to establish whether melatonin alters basal and/or stimulated oxytocin secretion, 18 normal men were treated (p.o.) with 6 or 12 mg melatonin or placebo in basal conditions (N-6 subjects) or concomitantly to the administration of insulin (O.15 IU/kg body weight in an i.v. bolus) (N-6 subjects) or angiotensin II (increasing doses of 4, 8 and 16 ng/kg/min, at intervals of 20 min)
IEPA.d76.s184	In contrast, the oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was significantly reduced by melatonin treatment
IEPA.d84.s199	Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics
IEPA.d84.s200	Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion
IEPA.d84.s201	DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion
IEPA.d84.s202	Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min
IEPA.d84.s203	CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous insulin secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the OT secretory system in IDDM
IEPA.d87.s206	These findings led us to conclude that inositol trisphosphate [corrected] causes Ca2+ mobilization by muscarinic activation of PLC, leading to intracellular translocation of insulin granules to the ready-releasable pool in pancreatic beta-cells via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chains
IEPA.d90.s213	DNase1 footprints suggest the involvement of at least three types of transcription factors in the regulation of alpha-Amy2/A by gibberellin
IEPA.d90.s214	The regulation of alpha-Amy2 genes by GA therefore involves an interplay of at least three different types of transcription factor
IEPA.d112.s270	Analyses of hormone regulation of expression of mRNA for the aleurone RNase revealed that, like the pattern for alpha-amylase, mRNA levels increased in the presence of gibberellic acid, and its antagonist abscisic acid prevented this effect
IEPA.d112.s271	Quantitative studies at early times demonstrated that cycloheximide treatment of aleurone layers increased mRNA levels 4-fold, whereas a combination of gibberellin plus cycloheximide treatment was required to increase alpha-amylase mRNA levels to the same extent
IEPA.d156.s373	Leptin is a satiety factor which acts within the hypothalamus to decrease the levels of several neuropeptides stimulating food intake (among them, neuropeptide Y [NPY]), while increasing those that inhibit food intake
IEPA.d175.s424	Although the above data are consistent with a direct ability of leptin to promote TRH biosynthesis through actions on TRH neurons, addition of a-MSH produced a 3.5 fold increase in TRH biosynthesis and release, whereas NPY treatment suppressed ~3 fold proTRH biosynthesis
