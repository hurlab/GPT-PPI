IEPA.d2.s2	SP ewes also had greater incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (+3449%, p less than 0.01) and total inositol phosphate (IP) (+760%, p less than 0.08), in response to oxytocin, than did oCSP ewes (+553 and +168% for IP3 and total IP, respectively) in endometrium collected at ovariectomy/hysterectomy on Day 16
IEPA.d2.s3	These results indicate that oTP-1 may prevent luteolysis by inhibiting development of endometrial responsiveness to oxytocin and, therefore, reduce oxytocin-induced synthesis of IP3 and PGF2 alpha
IEPA.d26.s56	The SGR and RGR also had different endocrine profiles with, for example, twice as high oxytocin (p < 0.01) and insulin levels (p < 0.01) in RGR compared to the SGR
IEPA.d37.s91	These findings support the concept that the mitochondrial metabolism of nutrient molecules is an event sufficient to acutely augment insulin release from the beta cell, to increase phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and to induce time-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion
IEPA.d45.s114	Cellular preincubation with 200 microg/ml antibodies against the inositolphosphoglycan (IPG) moiety of the GPI-anchor (Ab(IPG)), or depletion in GPI-anchored proteins by cellular pretreatment with 0.5 U/ml PI-PLC, 1 mM insulin and 2 HU/ml streptolysin-O, or depletion in membrane cholesterol content by filipin (5 microg/ml), digitonin (5 microg/ml) and cholesterol oxidase (0.5 U/ml) decreases the HDL3-signal, suggesting the involvement of a lipolytic cleavage of GPI-anchored proteins
IEPA.d55.s139	After protein kinase C activity was functionally depleted by treating cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 hours, AVP did not augment IL-1beta-induced NO production
IEPA.d55.s140	The effect of AVP was also inhibited in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C
IEPA.d55.s141	The addition of AVP increased protein kinase C activity in cardiac myocytes, and its effect was significantly inhibited in the presence of calphostin C
IEPA.d55.s142	These results support the hypothesis that the heart may be a target organ for AVP and that AVP modulates IL-1beta-induced iNOS expression in myocytes through the V1a receptor, which is mediated at least partially via activation of protein kinase C
IEPA.d58.s150	We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells
IEPA.d58.s151	In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date
IEPA.d58.s152	Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH
IEPA.d58.s153	We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.
IEPA.d86.s205	These observations suggest that bradykinin, like oxytocin, activates phospholipase C which generates IP3 with a subsequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by store-operated Ca2+ influx
IEPA.d106.s245	Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors reversed AVP inhibition, whereas PKC activator inhibited nitrite production
