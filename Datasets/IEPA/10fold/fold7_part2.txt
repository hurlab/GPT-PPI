IEPA.d41.s101	The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of phospholipase C distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of insulin secretion from mouse but not rat islets
IEPA.d41.s102	The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated phospholipase C isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different insulin secretory responses under these unique conditions
IEPA.d44.s112	Further, the oxytocin-induced activation of IK(sl) was effectively antagonized by 5 x 10(-8) mol/l U-73122 or 5 x 10(-6) mol/l 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate (inhibitors of the cell membrane phospholipase C), as well as by intracellularly applied heparin (selective inhibitor of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release channels)
IEPA.d44.s113	The data obtained suggest (i) that selective oxytocin receptors are present on the membranes of guinea-pig antral smooth muscle cells, (ii) that the oxytocin-related relaxation may result from the activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ conductivity via activation of IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from the submembrane located cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and (iii) in turn, this evokes a non-inactivating component of IK, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane
IEPA.d88.s207	To elucidate the pathophysiologic significance of UCP3 and UCP2 in the effect of TZDs on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure, we examined their basal mRNA levels in the WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle from Wistar fatty rats, a rat model of NIDDM and obesity with leptin receptor defect, and investigated expression of the genes encoding UCP3 and UCP2 in Wistar fatty rats and in Wistar lean rats with 2-week oral administration of 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pioglitazone, a TZD derivative
IEPA.d88.s208	These results clearly demonstrate that UCP3 gene expression is upregulated by TZDs in the WAT and BAT in Wistar fatty rats, an obese model with leptin receptor defect, and that adipose UCP3 gene expression is increased in response to TZDs in vitro
IEPA.d99.s237	Enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis via overexpression of phospholipase C beta1 or delta1 inhibits stimulus-induced insulin release in insulinoma MIN6 cells.
IEPA.d99.s238	To study the effects of enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis on insulin secretion, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1) or PLCdelta1 was overexpressed in insulinoma MIN6 cells via adenoviral vectors.
IEPA.d111.s269	Plasma oxytocin, and some functionally related peptides (CCK, gastrin, somatostatin and insulin), were measured by standard radioimmunoassay techniques
IEPA.d119.s287	The gibberellin-responsive elements conserved in cereal alpha-amylase genes are not included in the 5'-upstream region of Rep1 or RepA
IEPA.d141.s338	Tolbutamide and diazoxide modulate phospholipase C-linked Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion in beta-cells
IEPA.d141.s339	We examined whether tolbutamide and diazoxide, which close or open ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels), respectively, interact with PLC-linked Ca(2+) signals in HIT-T15 and mouse beta-cells and with PLC-linked insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells
IEPA.d141.s340	Thus tolbutamide and diazoxide regulate both PLC-linked Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by modulating K(ATP) channels, thereby determining voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) influx
IEPA.d152.s368	We examined for the first time in young men effects of intravenous injections of NPY (4x50 or 100 microg, n = 9 and 11, respectively, at 22.00, 23.00, 24.00 and 01.00 compared to saline) on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG; recorded from 23.00 to 07.00) and nocturnal secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin and leptin
IEPA.d184.s441	These results suggest that T3 may increase UCP family expression independent of leptin action
