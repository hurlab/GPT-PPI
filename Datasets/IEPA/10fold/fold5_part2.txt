IEPA.d77.s185	Although osmotic stimuli cause an increase in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity as well as synthesis of AVP and oxytocin in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON), it is not known whether NOS activity in the hypothalamus changes in the diabetic patients who have plasma hyperosmolality with hyperglycaemia caused by insulin deficiency
IEPA.d77.s186	Three weeks after administration of STZ, the diabetic rats were subcutaneously treated with insulin for 1 week, which resulted in significant suppression of the induction of nNOS, AVP and oxytocin gene expression in the PVN and SON
IEPA.d96.s231	Downregulation of uncoupling protein 2 mRNA in white adipose tissue and uncoupling protein 3 mRNA in skeletal muscle during the early stages of leptin treatment
IEPA.d96.s232	Leptin by intravenous or intracerebroventricular infusion for 5 h was associated with a decrease in UCP-2 mRNA in WAT (47-52%) and UCP-3 mRNA in SM (33-37%)
IEPA.d96.s233	Denervation suppressed mRNA levels for UCP-2 (49%), UCP-3 (36%), and COX-IV (59%) and eliminated the acute response to leptin in SM
IEPA.d120.s288	Furthermore, our 14C-acetate-labeling studies showed a 50% reduction in cholesteryl ester synthesis in the presence of either flavonoid, which could account for the reduction in net apoB secretion caused by incubation with these compounds
IEPA.d132.s319	The effects of the fluorinated analogues were evaluated on inhibition of cress seed germination and inhibition of gibberellin-inducible alpha-amylase induction in embryoless barley half-seeds
IEPA.d132.s320	(2E, 4E)-2-Fluoro-5-(1'-hydroxy-2',6', 6'-trimethyl-2'-cyclohexen-1'-yl)-3-methyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid (5b) showed potent inhibitory activity at the same level as ABA in the cress seed germination test, and 5b also inhibited gibberellin-inducible alpha-amylase induction at 4 x 10(-)(6), 3 times the concentration of ABA (1 x 10(-)(6)) for 50% inhibition of alpha-amylase production
IEPA.d134.s322	Isolation and characterization of gibbestatin B, an inhibitor of gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase, and gibbestatin C from streptomycetaes
IEPA.d139.s333	Leptin and UCP (1 and 2) mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methodology in adipose tissue and gastrocnemius muscle
IEPA.d139.s334	A negative correlation between WAT O2 consumption and UCP2 expression was found in control animals, but not in the cafeteria-fed groups, suggesting a differential response to the beta3-adrenergic compound in lean and obese animals, which is in agreement with the reported statistical interactions between obesity and Trecadrine administration found for WAT O2 consumption and muscle UCP2 expression, as well as for plasma leptin and WAT leptin expression
IEPA.d164.s396	The aims of this study were: (1) to assess the effects of maternal undernutrition during pregnancy on adult offspring with regard to growth, body composition and plasma levels of glucose, insulin and corticosterone, and (2) to investigate whether oxytocin treatment early in life could ameliorate the adverse effects of food restriction in utero
IEPA.d171.s415	Phospholipase C (PLC) activity was investigated by stimulation of membrane preparations obtained from insulin (beta-TC3)-, somatostatin (Rin 1027-B2)-, and glucagon (INR1-G9)-producing pancreatic cell lines using the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPgammaS alone, the C-terminal octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK-8), or gastrin
IEPA.d172.s416	Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation.
IEPA.d172.s417	However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells.
