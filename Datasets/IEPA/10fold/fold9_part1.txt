IEPA.d19.s41	Granulosa cells were isolated from bovine preovulatory follicles and cultured for 3 days with or without OT in medium supplemented with either insulin (1 microgram/ml) + 1% fetal calf serum (FCS), which maintains basal estradiol secretion, or low doses of FSH (1 and 2 ng/ml) + 1% FCS, a culture condition that maximizes effects of FSH on estradiol secretion
IEPA.d36.s87	Wortmannin converts insulin but not oxytocin from an antilipolytic to a lipolytic agent in the presence of forskolin
IEPA.d36.s88	The present studies compared the effects of insulin in rat adipocytes with the effects of oxytocin and peroxovanadate, which mimic some effects of insulin
IEPA.d36.s89	The antilipolytic effects of peroxovanadate and oxytocin were unaffected by 500 nmol/L wortmannin, which blocked the antilipolytic action of insulin
IEPA.d36.s90	The data provide additional support for the hypothesis that oxytocin and peroxovanadate affect adipose tissue metabolism by mechanisms distinctly different from those involved in insulin action
IEPA.d54.s138	This effect is maximal at 10(-8) M AVP (a concentration clearly above the normal physiological range of AVP concentrations) and involves the V2 receptor pathway, while activation of protein kinase C or changes in intracellular calcium are ineffective
IEPA.d57.s146	Activation of EGFR overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a 3.4 +/- 1.2-fold stimulation of PLC activity over basal levels vs. only 1.06 +/- 0.01-fold stimulation by insulin.
IEPA.d57.s147	Despite the low levels of insulin-induced PLC activity, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition)
IEPA.d57.s148	Inhibition of PLC activation did not impair either EGF- or insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and insulin-induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport.
IEPA.d57.s149	The diminution of glucose transport secondary to inhibition of PLC activity was reflected by a decrease in GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane upon either EGF or insulin stimulation
IEPA.d62.s159	Oxytocin-treated male rats had increased circulating levels of cholecystokinin, a tendency to increased plasma levels of insulin (p = 0.066), and relatively more adipose tissue in the thigh and interscapular region, compared with controls
IEPA.d65.s163	Vasopressin-induced activation of protein kinase C in renal epithelial cells
IEPA.d65.s164	AVP induced a biphasic increase in diacylglycerol generation, characterized by an initial rapid rise and then a sustained elevation, and PKC activation, reflected by phosphorylation of a specific 80 kDa myristoylated alanine-rich PKC substrate (MARCKS)
