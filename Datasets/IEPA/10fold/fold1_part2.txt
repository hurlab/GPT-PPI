IEPA.d106.s246	The inhibitory action of AVP involves both the activation of PKC and the transcription of iNOS mRNA in cultured rat GMC
IEPA.d121.s289	An inhibitor of PKC, Ro31-8220 (10 microM), abolished the ability of PDBu to decrease [Ca(2+)](i), without affecting the response to maximal or submaximal concentrations of AVP
IEPA.d137.s325	We previously showed that arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) induction through protein kinase C activation in aortic smooth muscle A10 cells
IEPA.d137.s326	Calphostin C and ET-18-OCH(3), inhibitors of protein kinase C, reduced the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase by AVP
IEPA.d146.s351	Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin
IEPA.d146.s352	The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM)
IEPA.d146.s353	The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP
IEPA.d146.s354	Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP
IEPA.d146.s355	Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP
IEPA.d146.s356	We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells
IEPA.d161.s386	Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion
IEPA.d161.s387	Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia
IEPA.d161.s388	Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion
IEPA.d161.s389	These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins
IEPA.d169.s409	The body mass index (BMI), leptin, plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY), serotonin, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) in serum were evaluated for each subject
IEPA.d174.s422	Dietary intakes of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones by Japanese women and the inverse correlation between quercetin intake and plasma LDL cholesterol concentration
