LLL.d1.s0	In this mutant, expression of the spoIIG gene, whose transcription depends on both sigma(A) and the phosphorylated Spo0A protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.
LLL.d5.s0	In the shaA mutant, sigma(H)-dependent expression of spo0A and spoVG at an early stage of sporulation was sensitive to external NaCl.
LLL.d44.s0	The sigma W regulon includes a penicillin binding protein (PBP4*) and a co-transcribed amino acid racemase (RacX), homologues of signal peptide peptidase (YteI), flotillin (YuaG), ABC transporters (YknXYZ), non-haem bromoperoxidase (YdjP), epoxide hydrolase (YfhM) and three small peptides with structural similarities to bacteriocin precursor polypeptides.
LLL.d28.s0	Primer extension experiments and Northern blot analysis show that an active sigmaA-dependent promoter precedes kdgR and transcription is terminated at the putative p-independent terminator downstream of kdgT.
LLL.d43.s0	The sspH and sspL genes are recognized primarily by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase, sigmaG; the sspN-tlp operon is recognized equally well by sigmaG and the other forespore-specific sigma factor, sigmaF.
