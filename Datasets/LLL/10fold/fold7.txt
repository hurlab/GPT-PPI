LLL.d0.s0	In vivo studies of the activity of four of the kinases, KinA, KinC, KinD (ykvD) and KinE (ykrQ), using abrB transcription as an indicator of Spo0A~P level, revealed that KinC and KinD were responsible for Spo0A~P production during the exponential phase of growth in the absence of KinA and KinB.
LLL.d7.s0	Expression of the sigma(K)-dependent cwlH gene depended on gerE.
LLL.d16.s0	(i) The finding that the bmrUR operon is under sigmaB control indicates that the elimination of multidrug compounds might be a new function in multiple stress resistance.
LLL.d16.s1	The ydaP gene might belong to the increasing number of sigmaB-dependent genes whose orthologues are under the control of sigmas in Escherichia coli, indicating that both regulons may fulfil similar functions.
LLL.d16.s2	Three new sigmaB-dependent genes (ydaE, ydaG and yfkM) encoding proteins with still unknown functions were also described.
LLL.d13.s0	Production of sigmaK about 1 h earlier than normal does affect Spo0A, which when phosphorylated is an activator of sigE transcription.
LLL.d13.s1	The ald promoter, like the sigE promoter, is believed to be recognized by sigmaA RNA polymerase, suggesting that sigmaK may inhibit sigmaA activity late in sporulation.
LLL.d13.s2	In the mother cell compartment of sporulating cells, expression of the sigE gene, encoding the earlier-acting sigma factor, sigmaE, is negatively regulated by the later-acting sigma factor, sigmaK.
