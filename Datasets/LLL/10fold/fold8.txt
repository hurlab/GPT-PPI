LLL.d2.s0	Transcription of ydhD was dependent on SigE, and the mRNA was detectable from 2 h after the cessation of logarithmic growth (T2 of sporulation).
LLL.d2.s1	ykuD was transcribed by SigK RNA polymerase from T4 of sporulation.
LLL.d2.s2	Both SigK and GerE were essential for ykvP expression, and this gene was transcribed from T5 of sporulation.
LLL.d26.s0	From these results we conclude that ComK negatively regulates degR expression by preventing sigmaD-driven transcription of degR, possibly through interaction with the control region.
LLL.d26.s1	We have shown previously that the transcription of degR is driven by an alternative sigma factor, sigmaD.
LLL.d27.s0	DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in the cotC promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the cotX promoter, and does not bind specifically to cotB.
LLL.d27.s1	Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE.
LLL.d27.s2	In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID.
LLL.d27.s3	A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or cotC.
LLL.d27.s4	SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.
LLL.d39.s0	The addition of ClpX to in vitro transcription reactions resulted in the stimulation of RNAP holoenzyme activity, but sigmaH-RNAP was observed to be more sensitive to ClpX-dependent stimulation than sigmaA-RNAP.
