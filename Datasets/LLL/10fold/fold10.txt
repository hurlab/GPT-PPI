LLL.d4.s0	Secondly, SpoIIE is essential for the activation of the first compartment-specific transcription factor sigma(F) in the prespore.
LLL.d4.s1	Localization of SpoIIE was shown to be dependent on the essential cell division protein FtsZ.
LLL.d17.s0	Cell specificity is first established in the forespore under the control of the sigma F factor, which is itself activated through the action of the SpoIIE serine phosphatase, an enzyme targeted to the septum between the two cells.
LLL.d20.s0	ComK negatively controls the transcription of hag by stimulating the transcription of comF-flgM, thereby increasing the production of the FlgM antisigma factor that inhibits sigmaD activity.
LLL.d35.s0	The Bacillus subtilis clpC operon is regulated by two stress induction pathways relying on either sigmaB or a class III stress induction mechanism acting at a sigmaA-like promoter.
LLL.d35.s1	Our data demonstrate that the CtsR protein acts as a global repressor of the clpC operon, as well as other class III heat shock genes, by preventing unstressed transcription from either the sigmaB- or sigmaA-dependent promoter and might be inactivated or dissociate under inducing stress conditions.
