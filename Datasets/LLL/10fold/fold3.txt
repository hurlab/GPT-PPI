LLL.d19.s0	sspG transcription also requires the DNA binding protein GerE.
LLL.d19.s1	In contrast, sspJ is transcribed in the forespore compartment by RNA polymerase with the forespore-specific sigmaG and appears to give a monocistronic transcript.
LLL.d23.s0	Transcriptional studies showed that nadE is strongly induced in response to heat, ethanol and salt stress or after starvation for glucose in a sigma B-dependent manner.
LLL.d31.s0	The results indicate that PhoP~P is sufficient to repress the transcription of the tagA and tagD promoters and also to activate the transcription of the tuaA promoter.
LLL.d33.s0	During endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis, the DNA binding protein GerE stimulates transcription from several promoters that are used by RNA polymerase containing sigmaK
LLL.d33.s1	GerE binds to a site on one of these promoters, cotX, that overlaps its -35 region.
LLL.d42.s0	Finally, we show that proper localization of SpoIVA required the expression of one or more genes which, like spoIVA, are under the control of the mother cell transcription factor sigmaE.
