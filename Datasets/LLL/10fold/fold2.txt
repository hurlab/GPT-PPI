LLL.d12.s0	Northern blot and primer extension analyses indicated that yfhS is transcribed by E sigma E during sporulation.
LLL.d12.s1	These results suggest that YfhP may act as a negative regulator for the transcription of yfhQ, yfhR, sspE and yfhP.
LLL.d22.s0	sigma X also contributes to the expression of CsbB, a putative membrane-bound glucosyl transferase that is partially controlled by the sigma B stress response sigma factor.
LLL.d25.s0	The expression of the bkd operon was induced by the presence of isoleucine or valine in the growth medium and depended upon the presence of the sigma factor SigL, a member of the sigma 54 family.
LLL.d32.s0	Transcriptional studies demonstrated that the expression from the araE promoter is induced by L-arabinose, repressed by glucose, and negatively regulated by AraR.
LLL.d40.s0	Although spo0H is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the Spo0 phosphorelay, there is considerable evidence implicating a mechanism of post-translational control that governs the activity and concentration of sigmaH.
