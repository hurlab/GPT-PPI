Consider each sentence separately and infer Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) for only the protein entity pairs PROTEIN1-PROTEIN2 from the provided sentences. Do not consider any other PROTEIN pairs. Here original protein names are masked using the terms PROTEIN, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2.
Please, format your results in CSV (comma-separated values) format with the following two columns: 'Sentence ID' and 'PPI between PROTEIN1-PROTEIN2'. Ensure that no columns are left blank.
Output Column Specifications:
'Sentence ID': The unique identifier for each sentence.
'PPI between PROTEIN1-PROTEIN2': TRUE or FALSE. (If PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 interact: TRUE. If PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 do not interact FALSE)  
If all sentences have been processed successfully, the last row should only contain the word 'Done'.
Each input line contains a 'Sentence ID' and corresponding 'Sentence' that is needed to be analyzed for finding PPI. 
Here are the sentences that you need to process:
